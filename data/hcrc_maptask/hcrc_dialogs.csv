172,f,i've got a poisoned stream near there ,q7nc4
173,g,oh no like my poisoned stream's a lot more to the right but i've got a cobbled street right underneath the pyramid ,q7nc4
174,f,no ,q7nc4
175,g,right so ,q7nc4
176,g,have you have you drawn round the pyramid yet ,q7nc4
177,f,yeah ,q7nc4
178,f,i've drawn up above it and then down below again ,q7nc4
179,g,right ,q7nc4
180,g,if you could go along back to your left right to the end of the pyramid ,q7nc4
181,f,back to my left ,q7nc4
182,g,yeah ,q7nc4
183,g,so it's almost as if you're drawing right round it but not quite ,q7nc4
184,f,so like a triangle ,q7nc4
185,f,right okay ,q7nc4
186,g,yeah uh-huh ,q7nc4
187,f,right ,q7nc4
188,g,right excuse me coughing right ,q7nc4
189,g,we've got have you got a remote village further down ,q7nc4
190,f,yeah ,q7nc4
191,f,quite a bit down ,q7nc4
192,g,right okay now ,q7nc4
193,g,what we have to do is sort of veer to the left just a wee bit going straight down so that you come down underneath the remote village right and once you get to the ,q7nc4
194,g,you know on the left-hand side of it ,q7nc4
195,f,right ,q7nc4
196,g,okay ,q7nc4
197,g,and then what we need to do is turn turn right straight right f-- just 'til you're other side of the remote village and then that's us done ,q7nc4
198,f,right i'm down to the side of it ,q7nc4
199,f,underneath the poisoned stream sort of roughly ,q7nc4
200,g,well eh mine's is in a different position than yours so ,q7nc4
201,g,aye probably if yours is ,q7nc4
202,f,so the right-hand side of my right-hand side of the remote village is where we end yeah ,q7nc4
203,g,yeah ,q7nc4
204,g,but you come round the left-hand side underneath it and along to your right ,q7nc4
205,f,yeah ,q7nc4
206,g,okay ,q7nc4
207,f,so i'm sort of directly above the old temple is where i finish ,q7nc4
208,g,yeah ,q7nc4
209,g,roughly just yeah say maybe just just short of that ,q7nc4
210,f,right okay ,q7nc4
211,f,yeah well ,q7nc4
212,g,okay ,q7nc4
213,f,just short of it okay ,q7nc4
214,g,right ,q7nc4
215,f,and that's it finished ,q7nc4
216,g,yeah ,q7nc4
217,g,you put a big cross and your name on it and that ,q7nc4
218,f,yes ,q7nc4
0,g,right ,q4ec2
1,g,go vertically down until you're underneath eh diamond mine ,q4ec2
2,g,then eh go right until you're between springbok --boks and highest viewpoint ,q4ec2
3,f,where ,q4ec2
4,g,right ,q4ec2
5,g,right go right ,q4ec2
6,f,don't think i've got that on mine ,q4ec2
7,g,ah right ,q4ec2
8,f,right directly to your right ,q4ec2
9,g,right to your right where what is the next obstacle ,q4ec2
10,f,ehm quite far over is overgrown gully ,q4ec2
11,g,overgrown what ,q4ec2
12,f,right so where you've got highest viewpoint is there anything below that ,q4ec2
13,g,ehm no ,q4ec2
14,f,well i've got overgrown gully ,q4ec2
15,g,ah right overgrown gully ,q4ec2
16,g,there's no such thing eh on my map ,q4ec2
17,g,ehm the next one you've got to go to can you see springboks on yours ,q4ec2
18,f,no ,q4ec2
19,f,where's that in relation to highest viewpoint ,q4ec2
20,g,it's right next to it virtually ,q4ec2
21,f,to its right or left ,q4ec2
22,g,to its left ,q4ec2
23,f,on the same level as highest viewpoint yeah ,q4ec2
24,g,just slightly below it ,q4ec2
25,f,okay right ,q4ec2
26,g,right n-- ,q4ec2
27,g,go along to your right eh from where you last drew eh in a straight line horizontally ,q4ec2
28,f,uh-huh ,q4ec2
29,g,and then go up between the the two words springboks and highest viewpoint ,q4ec2
30,f,uh-huh ,q4ec2
31,g,and then ehm once you then go round the top eh go to your right eh horizontally go ,q4ec2
32,g,wh-- wh-- where are you at the moment are you just at s-- springboks here ,q4ec2
33,f,well where i think that is ,q4ec2
34,f,and the highest viewpoint's above where i am just now ,q4ec2
35,g,right okay ,q4ec2
36,g,right go vertically up then between the the springboks and highest viewpoint ,q4ec2
37,f,okay am i meant to be trying to go under highest viewpoint like under ,q4ec2
38,g,no no ,q4ec2
39,g,you're meant to be going between eh springboks and highest po-- viewpoint ,q4ec2
40,f,okay ,q4ec2
41,g,and once you get to above highest viewpoint eh you go horizontally ,q4ec2
42,f,above highest viewpoint ,q4ec2
43,g,yes ,q4ec2
44,g,above highest ,q4ec2
45,f,uh-huh ,q4ec2
46,g,right then go eh uh to your right horizontally ,q4ec2
47,g,then eh come once you're once you've eh passed highest viewpoint eh and there's nothing below you a-- eh apart from safari truck ,q4ec2
48,g,if you can see that there ,q4ec2
49,f,uh-huh ,q4ec2
50,g,right go vertically down to just above s-- eh safari truck ,q4ec2
51,f,uh-huh ,q4ec2
52,g,right now what you want to do is diagonally eh from eh right to left go eh in front of safari truck ,q4ec2
53,f,like coming underneath it ,q4ec2
54,g,ehm you go up safari no no i don't mean go underneath it ,q4ec2
55,g,go like over it as it were ,q4ec2
56,f,uh-huh ,q4ec2
57,g,eh right so you're actually going from going diagonally eh from right to left above safari tr-- truck ,q4ec2
58,f,oh okay ,q4ec2
59,g,right ,q4ec2
60,f,to where ,q4ec2
61,g,to just ehm below the level of field station ,q4ec2
62,f,not got that ,q4ec2
63,f,have you got banana tree ,q4ec2
64,g,aye the banana tree bu-- ,q4ec2
65,g,is there a field station there as well ,q4ec2
66,f,no nothing there ,q4ec2
67,f,oh yeah yes uh-huh ,q4ec2
68,g,yeah right ,q4ec2
69,f,so i'm going towards field station ,q4ec2
70,g,yeah ,q4ec2
71,g,go towards field station right ,q4ec2
72,f,okay ,q4ec2
73,g,until you're eh u-- just underneath the level of the words field station ,q4ec2
74,f,okay ,q4ec2
75,g,these are identical maps i hope ,q4ec2
76,g,right eh right ,q4ec2
77,g,then you want to go horizontally eh from eh right to left eh above the banana tree above eh the actual banana tree itself ,q4ec2
78,f,i just double back the way ,q4ec2
79,g,yes ,q4ec2
80,g,like that ,q4ec2
81,f,okay ,q4ec2
82,f,where to ,q4ec2
83,g,right just p-- until you're past banana tree ,q4ec2
84,f,okay ,q4ec2
85,g,then come vertically down until you come to gold mine ,q4ec2
86,f,don't have a gold mine ,q4ec2
87,g,you don't have a gold mine ,q4ec2
88,f,no ,q4ec2
89,g,you must have a gold mine somewhere yeah ,q4ec2
90,f,i don't i didn't have that ,q4ec2
91,g,is it is it below banana tree ,q4ec2
92,f,no ,q4ec2
93,g,no ,q4ec2
94,f,rock fall i've got ,q4ec2
95,g,rock fall ,q4ec2
96,g,surely between rock fall and banana tree you've got a gold mine no ,q4ec2
97,f,no ,q4ec2
98,g,is it is it anywhere at all near ,q4ec2
99,f,i've got to the right of banana tree and down there's rope bridge ,q4ec2
100,g,eh say that again to the ,q4ec2
101,f,to the right of banana tree there's a rope bridge ,q4ec2
102,g,right ,q4ec2
103,g,now that's slightly down isn't it ,q4ec2
104,f,yeah uh-huh ,q4ec2
105,g,and eh rock fall is like eh it forms a triangle ,q4ec2
106,f,yeah that's right aye ,q4ec2
107,g,right ,q4ec2
108,g,ehm ,q4ec2
109,f,where's your gold mine ,q4ec2
110,g,well my gold mine is uh the eh the mid point of the banana tree and rock fall line ,q4ec2
111,f,right ,q4ec2
112,f,well no i haven't got that ,q4ec2
113,g,so you don't have that ehm right ,q4ec2
114,g,well mine that must mean that this that you can bypass this obstacle ,q4ec2
115,g,so ehm from where you are you're you're you're next to banana tree the word aren't you yeah is that where you are ,q4ec2
116,f,i'm above banana tree ,q4ec2
117,g,you're certainly above it right ,q4ec2
118,f,uh-huh ,q4ec2
119,g,okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree ,q4ec2
120,f,okay ,q4ec2
121,g,now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm ,q4ec2
122,g,just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got ,q4ec2
123,g,so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down ,q4ec2
124,f,from banana tree over to rope bridge ,q4ec2
125,g,yeah ,q4ec2
126,g,well no no ,q4ec2
127,g,no ,q4ec2
128,g,just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridge ,q4ec2
129,f,okay ,q4ec2
130,g,right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall line ,q4ec2
131,f,mmhmm ,q4ec2
132,g,it's just slightly below that ,q4ec2
133,g,ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle there ,q4ec2
134,f,sorry say that again ,q4ec2
135,g,right ,q4ec2
136,f,right i'm i'm beside rope bridge just now ,q4ec2
137,g,you're bes-- beside rope bridge ,q4ec2
138,f,did you mean just go straight keep going down but not go to ,q4ec2
139,g,yes ,q4ec2
140,g,i meant to go straight down yeah ,q4ec2
141,f,right okay ,q4ec2
142,f,i'll just change that ,q4ec2
143,g,right ,q4ec2
144,f,uh-huh ,q4ec2
145,g,right ,q4ec2
146,g,so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down right ,q4ec2
147,g,now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughly ,q4ec2
148,f,okay ,q4ec2
149,g,right ,q4ec2
150,g,then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridge ,q4ec2
151,f,mmhmm ,q4ec2
152,g,not the rope bridge word but the actual rope bridge itself ,q4ec2
153,f,mmhmm ,q4ec2
154,f,and this would be like sort of in the centre of the page ,q4ec2
155,g,it's more or less yes in the centre of the page ,q4ec2
156,f,roughly okay ,q4ec2
157,g,right ,q4ec2
158,g,then ,q4ec2
159,f,mmhmm ,q4ec2
160,g,right n-- from there you want to eh go from left to right across the rope bridge and it's actually ehm if if you think of a d-- it was it's not on the rope bridge the word but the rope bridge itself you want the the the line to pass through the diagram ,q4ec2
161,f,uh-huh right ,q4ec2
162,g,right ,q4ec2
163,f,okay ,q4ec2
164,g,right ,q4ec2
165,g,now do you have giraffes in eh below rope bridge roughly ,q4ec2
166,f,uh-huh ,q4ec2
167,g,right ,q4ec2
168,g,ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffes ,q4ec2
169,f,do you s-- do you have crocodiles underneath the rope bridge ,q4ec2
170,g,no ,q4ec2
171,g,right so there's crocodiles on yours ,q4ec2
172,g,ehm there's no crocodiles on mine ,q4ec2
173,g,whereabouts are they eh n-- as with respect to the rope bridge ,q4ec2
174,f,directly underneath the right-hand side of the rope bridge ,q4ec2
175,g,right i see right ,q4ec2
176,f,so if there's no obstruction beneath the rope bridge on the other side before you cross it do you think i could go from directly from there to the giraffes ,q4ec2
177,g,yeah i s-- i suppose if ,q4ec2
178,g,as long as we don't draw over the he-- the crocodiles themselves it'll be okay ,q4ec2
179,f,no that that won't that won't affect it ,q4ec2
180,g,right okay ,q4ec2
181,g,so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the page ,q4ec2
182,f,from before crossing the rope bridge ,q4ec2
183,g,well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge right ,q4ec2
184,f,but then i can't actually get from the other end of the rope bridge to the giraffes ,q4ec2
185,g,oh right ,q4ec2
186,g,so they're so they're actually barring that way ,q4ec2
187,f,without the crocodiles ,q4ec2
188,f,well i imagine so ,q4ec2
189,f,less i just drew round them which i suppose i could ,q4ec2
190,g,eh can you dr-- actually draw round them ,q4ec2
191,f,well yeah i suppose ,q4ec2
192,g,well if you could draw round them then ,q4ec2
193,f,straight down to the giraffes ,q4ec2
194,g,yeah ,q4ec2
195,g,just to the left eh t-- sorry to the right of the giraffes in between the the edge of the page and the giraffes ,q4ec2
196,f,okay ,q4ec2
197,g,right ,q4ec2
198,g,now ,q4ec2
199,g,you want to go from there eh to your eh left just underneath the giraffes ,q4ec2
200,g,now is there any obstacle there ,q4ec2
201,f,there's the disused warehouse ,q4ec2
202,f,you got that ,q4ec2
203,g,disthouse u-- no i don't have that ,q4ec2
204,g,it's another obstacle right ,q4ec2
205,g,ehm if you can just go round eh above the eh disused warehouse ,q4ec2
206,g,and then you want to go eh under the great lake and to the finish ,q4ec2
207,f,under the great lake ,q4ec2
208,g,yeah ,q4ec2
209,f,where's the finish just there ,q4ec2
210,g,well the finish is just between rock fall and great lake it's n-- it's not directly between them but it's on the same level as that ,q4ec2
211,f,okay ,q4ec2
212,g,so that's it finished then ,q4ec2
0,g,ehm can you see a caravan park ,q5nc1
1,g,your route is to your left of that ,q5nc1
2,f,left ,q5nc1
3,g,left i think ,q5nc1
4,f,i'm going to end up off the paper if i go left ,q5nc1
5,g,no ,q5nc1
6,g,you have to go round that side though ,q5nc1
7,f,oh right right ,q5nc1
8,f,going left ,q5nc1
9,g,and ,q5nc1
10,g,then you go ahead mm you should see an old mill on your left again ,q5nc1
11,g,if you're going down if you're going down ,q5nc1
12,f,eh no ,q5nc1
13,f,aye you forgot to tell me to go down ,q5nc1
14,g,no but you go down ,q5nc1
15,f,right ,q5nc1
16,g,ehm turn to your left ,q5nc1
17,f,i can't go left i havenae got to the old mill yet ,q5nc1
18,g,no ,q5nc1
19,g,you don't go to the old mill ,q5nc1
20,f,i can't go any further left i'm right beside the paper ,q5nc1
21,g,okay ,q5nc1
22,g,from the beginning you go down ,q5nc1
23,g,right ,q5nc1
24,f,yeah right i've done that ,q5nc1
25,g,right ,q5nc1
26,g,then you turn left at the bottom of the paper or turn ,q5nc1
27,f,so you want me to go right down to the bottom of the paper and then turn left ,q5nc1
28,g,mmhmm ,q5nc1
29,g,but turn left as if you're walking down ,q5nc1
30,f,what ,q5nc1
31,g,turn into the paper ,q5nc1
32,g,okay ,q5nc1
33,g,don't turn off the paper ,q5nc1
34,f,right ,q5nc1
35,g,okay ,q5nc1
36,g,then head along slightly and then turn left again ,q5nc1
37,f,have i got left and right mixed up here ,q5nc1
38,f,no i haven't ,q5nc1
39,f,i can't go any further left i'm right at the left-hand side of the paper right i'm about a centimetre away from it ,q5nc1
40,g,oh ,q5nc1
41,g,well ,q5nc1
42,g,if you can't can't turn left turn right ,q5nc1
43,f,right that's a good idea ,q5nc1
44,g,yeah ,q5nc1
45,f,right ,q5nc1
46,g,and then ,q5nc1
47,g,when you see the old mill above you ,q5nc1
48,f,mmhmm ,q5nc1
49,g,turn up the way and you're going past the old mill ,q5nc1
50,f,right ,q5nc1
51,g,with it on your ,q5nc1
52,f,left ,q5nc1
53,g,right ,q5nc1
54,f,right ,q5nc1
55,g,right yes oh yeah ,q5nc1
56,g,you've got to go round with it on your right-hand side ,q5nc1
57,f,with it on your right-hand side ,q5nc1
58,g,yeah ,q5nc1
59,f,oh hell back i go right ,q5nc1
60,g,right okay ,q5nc1
61,f,mmhmm ,q5nc1
62,g,now ,q5nc1
63,g,you go round the top of the mill ,q5nc1
64,f,mmhmm ,q5nc1
65,g,and ehm ,q5nc1
66,g,he-- continue heading towards your right past the mill ,q5nc1
67,f,right ,q5nc1
68,g,you should see um a fenced meadow down at the bottom ,q5nc1
69,f,aye ,q5nc1
70,g,okay ,q5nc1
71,g,ehm ,q5nc1
72,g,now ,q5nc1
73,g,if you're heading along that way turn up left ,q5nc1
74,g,you should see an abandoned cottage up the way ,q5nc1
75,f,no wait a minute ,q5nc1
76,f,do you want me to go past the fenced meadow ,q5nc1
77,g,eh ,q5nc1
78,f,or just look at it ,q5nc1
79,g,don't go near no ,q5nc1
80,g,don't go near e-- either of the fenced meadows ,q5nc1
81,f,can only see one fenced meadow ,q5nc1
82,g,there are two ,q5nc1
83,g,there's one above the caravan park and one over from the old mill ,q5nc1

103,g,and you come ,q5nc1
104,g,oh i'll have to take this off ,q5nc1
105,g,right ,q5nc1
106,g,you come down slightly to your left if you're heading that way ,q5nc1
107,g,but you don't have another fenced meadow ,q5nc1
108,f,nope ,q5nc1
109,g,nope ,q5nc1
110,f,just an empty space ,q5nc1
111,g,mm ,q5nc1
112,g,okay anyway now ,q5nc1
113,g,you should see west lake ,q5nc1
114,f,aye ,q5nc1
115,g,head up towards west lake ,q5nc1
116,f,aye ,q5nc1
117,g,now ,q5nc1
118,g,when you get there you're going to have to go very close to it but round the side of it ,q5nc1
119,f,right ,q5nc1
120,f,which which way round the side clockwise or anticlockwise ,q5nc1
121,g,erm towards towards the trig point ,q5nc1
122,g,do you see that ,q5nc1
123,f,the what ,q5nc1
124,g,the trig point ,q5nc1
125,f,what's a trig point ,q5nc1
126,g,can you see a trig point ,q5nc1
127,f,i don't know what a trig point is ,q5nc1
128,g,there should should be marked on your map ,q5nc1

106,f,right ,q2nc8
107,g,right ,q2nc8
108,g,what you're going to do is you're going to continue your downward line for about another inch moving down towards let me see in a compass direction it would be southwest ,q2nc8
109,g,right just continue down the way ,q2nc8
110,f,right ,q2nc8

112,g,moving both outwards and downwards ,q2nc8
113,f,right ,q2nc8
114,g,okay ,q2nc8
115,g,now skim a line that's pointing diagonally up if you take a point about an inch and a half from the edge of the page ,q2nc8

117,g,level from where you are ,q2nc8
118,g,okay ,q2nc8
119,f,okay ,q2nc8
120,g,then move that point up half an inch so you've got a kind of diagonal line again ,q2nc8

133,g,you could come in a wee bit so that when you go up you uh you go up to the top left-hand corner of the stile but you're only say about a centimetre from the edge so that's your line ,q2nc8
134,f,okay ,q2nc8
135,g,your point should be downwards you probably got the distance correct down the way but that'll be your route ,q2nc8

50,g,un-- ,q4ec7
51,g,no ,q4ec7
52,g,'til you've f-- maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round ,q4ec7
53,f,below the writing of rope bridge ,q4ec7
54,g,no ,q4ec7
55,f,below ,q4ec7
56,g,below ,q4ec7
57,g,do you ha-- the left-hand side of the rope bridge ,q4ec7
58,f,uh-huh ,q4ec7
59,g,but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge ,q4ec7
60,f,okay ,q4ec7
61,f,so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah ,q4ec7
62,g,yes you cro-- ,q4ec7
63,f,okay ,q4ec7
64,g,are you crossing the rope bridge ,q4ec7
65,f,you want me to cross it uh-huh ,q4ec7
66,g,well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge ,q4ec7
67,f,okay ,q4ec7
68,g,and then stop when you get to the other side ,q4ec7
69,f,uh-huh ,q4ec7
70,g,because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide cur-- curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres ,q4ec7
71,f,mmhmm ,q4ec7
72,g,so ,q4ec7
73,f,do you have a machete ,q4ec7
74,g,instead ,q4ec7
75,g,no i don't ,q4ec7
76,g,where's the machete ,q4ec7
77,f,it's to the right and just down ,q4ec7
78,g,from the rope bridge ,q4ec7
79,f,it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge ,q4ec7
80,f,so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay ,q4ec7
81,g,is that curving down a lot ,q4ec7
82,g,'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down ,q4ec7
83,f,mmhmm ,q4ec7
84,f,well where would i go once i curve down on your map ,q4ec7
85,g,you turn right and go straight across so you're th-- you're about three centimetres above the start position ,q4ec7
86,f,okay that's fine ,q4ec7
87,f,i'll just go underneath it then ,q4ec7
88,g,and stop when you're you're ,q4ec7
89,g,have you got a collapsed shelter ,q4ec7
90,f,uh-huh ,q4ec7
91,f,just above there ,q4ec7
92,g,yeah ,q4ec7
93,f,so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-huh ,q4ec7
94,g,about two centimetr-- me-- --metres underneath it ,q4ec7
95,f,that's fine ,q4ec7
96,g,have you got a saxon barn ,q4ec7
97,f,uh-huh ,q4ec7
98,g,well you go straight up from that point where you were ,q4ec7
99,f,mm ,q4ec7
100,g,past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter ,q4ec7
101,g,just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn ,q4ec7
102,f,mmhmm ,q4ec7
103,f,so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to left ,q4ec7
104,g,and stop there ,q4ec7
105,g,no ,q4ec7
106,g,straight line up to s-- the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map ,q4ec7
107,f,so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the ,q4ec7
108,g,no ,q4ec7
109,g,straight line upwards ,q4ec7
110,f,well i can't do that ,q4ec7
111,g,why not ,q4ec7
112,f,'cause my saxon barn's on the ,q4ec7
113,g,no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter ,q4ec7
114,f,uh-huh ,q4ec7
115,g,you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it ,q4ec7
116,f,oh okay ,q4ec7
117,f,have you got a crevasse ,q4ec7
118,g,no ,q4ec7
119,f,well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn ,q4ec7
120,g,no ,q4ec7
121,g,so if you go straight up would you c-- curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn ,q4ec7
122,f,if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up ,q4ec7
123,f,would that be okay ,q4ec7
124,g,if you go well i was going ,q4ec7
125,f,so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yeah ,q4ec7
126,g,but the the top of it ,q4ec7
127,f,okay ,q4ec7
128,g,just a bit above ,q4ec7
129,g,and you go straight up and curve round and then down and underneath the saxon barn ,q4ec7
130,f,say that again ,q4ec7
131,f,i'm on just now i'm on a horizontal line just beside above the saxon barn ,q4ec7
132,g,but not right over it ,q4ec7
133,f,no ,q4ec7
134,f,i'm not beside it yet ,q4ec7
135,g,no right ,q4ec7
136,g,ehm so you would ,q4ec7
137,g,ehm is where's the crevasse from there is it underneath you ,q4ec7
138,f,it's just beside me just now it's just to my right like if i if i went sorry if i went to my left i would pass the crevasse and i would pass the saxon barn ,q4ec7
139,g,right ,q4ec7
140,g,so if you go over the top of the crevasse and down the side of it then underneath the saxon barn ,q4ec7
141,g,could you do that ,q4ec7
142,f,you want me to draw underneath the saxon barn ,q4ec7
143,g,yes ,q4ec7
144,f,uh-huh okay ,q4ec7
145,f,where will i stop ,q4ec7
146,g,"and stop ehm beside the ""s"" ",q4ec7
147,f,of saxon ,q4ec7
148,g,saxon ,q4ec7
149,f,okay ,q4ec7
150,g,and have you got pelicans ,q4ec7
151,f,no ,q4ec7
152,g,no ,q4ec7
153,g,ehm go down about three to four centimetres from the saxon barn vertically downwards ,q4ec7
154,f,so i'm above the rope bridge ,q4ec7
155,g,just a bit above the rope bridge yeah ,q4ec7
156,f,okay ,q4ec7
157,g,the end of it ,q4ec7
158,f,uh-huh ,q4ec7
159,g,and then go underneath where i've got pelicans towards the left-hand side ,q4ec7
160,f,mmhmm ,q4ec7
161,f,is that just beside the edge of the paper uh-huh ,q4ec7
162,g,uh-huh ,q4ec7

164,f,okay ,q4ec7
165,g,stop ,q4ec7
166,g,have you got a white mountain ,q4ec7
167,f,uh-huh ,q4ec7

230,g,okay ,q6ec2
231,f,okay ,q6ec2
232,g,move left from where you are at the moment so that you're above the stile but stop when you get past the stile ,q6ec2

256,g,go to the left ,q6ec2
257,f,right okay ,q6ec2
258,g,okay ,q6ec2

269,f,oh ,q6ec2
270,f,well ,q6ec2
271,f,i've missed it now ,q6ec2
272,g,now right ,q6ec2

317,f,above the stile ,q6ec2
318,g,above the stile ,q6ec2

328,f,i've gone i've gone further up ,q6ec2
329,g,right ,q6ec2
330,g,now move right and down in a sort of circular sweep until you get to the dead tree ,q6ec2
331,f,right ,q6ec2
332,f,to the tree ,q6ec2
333,f,yay ,q6ec2
334,g,and then move around a-- and ,q6ec2
335,f,what side of the tree do you want me to be on ,q6ec2
336,g,oh on the right side of the tree i want you to finish up on the right side of the tree ,q6ec2
337,f,right okay ,q6ec2
338,g,then move up and left and up so that you're to the right of the great viewpoint when you finish ,q6ec2
339,f,okay ,q6ec2
340,g,assuming that your great viewpoint's in the same place as mine ,q6ec2
341,f,oh i've got to be on the left hang on ,q6ec2

379,f,oh oh okay well ,q6ec2
380,f,if i just go up say about by the edge of the lake where it's ,q6ec2

406,f,and ,q6ec2
407,f,no ,q6ec2
408,f,two thirds along from the right ,q6ec2
409,g,i see ,q6ec2
410,g,no you want to be two thirds along from the left ,q6ec2
411,f,okay ,q6ec2

413,g,yeah ,q6ec2
414,f,okay ,q6ec2

19,g,then you want to start like carry on that curve for about f-- four or five inches just gradually heading up the way ,q5nc5
20,g,right ,q5nc5
21,f,so i'm making a curve round the diamond mine yeah ,q5nc5
22,g,no no no no ,q5nc5
23,f,no no no no ,q5nc5
24,g,f-- past the diamond mine ,q5nc5
25,g,not that not that steep a curve like just ,q5nc5
26,f,pass it ,q5nc5
27,f,yeah just slightly ,q5nc5
28,g,just like just more a wee bit more than a straight line along past the diamond mine ,q5nc5
29,f,yeah right okay right ,q5nc5
30,g,i sp-- i don't suppose you've got a graveyard have you ,q5nc5
31,f,ehm no ,q5nc5

69,f,mmhmm ,q5nc5
70,f,now where which way am i heading down ,q5nc5
71,g,you see the carved wooden pole at the bottom ,q5nc5
72,f,aye ,q5nc5
73,g,well ,q5nc5
74,g,you you need to be about two inch you you need to end up about two inches from the top there ,q5nc5
75,f,from the top ,q5nc5
76,g,two inches above it ,q5nc5
77,f,and it's on the left well i'm coming from the left to go to above it ,q5nc5
78,g,yeah ,q5nc5
79,f,right ,q5nc5
80,g,sort of curving round ,q5nc5
81,g,now see stone creek ,q5nc5
82,f,yeah ,q5nc5

89,g,great ehm ,q5nc5
90,g,okay ,q5nc5
91,g,head up ehm past stone creek you need to be going at about up curving up to the right at about a forty-five degree angle ,q5nc5
92,f,so i'm going over stone creek ,q5nc5
93,g,aye ,q5nc5
94,f,well ,q5nc5
95,f,above it anyway ,q5nc5
96,f,on no wait a minute i have got flat rocks ,q5nc5
97,g,right you well da-- ,q5nc5
98,g,right ,q5nc5
99,g,you're going past you're going up over stone creek ,q5nc5

101,f,yeah ,q5nc5
102,f,okay ,q5nc5
103,g,so that's where you want to end up ,q5nc5
104,f,right ,q5nc5
105,f,right ,q5nc5
106,g,now keep heading to the right a bit ,q5nc5
107,f,mmhmm ,q5nc5
108,g,further until you're about an inch away from the edge of the paper ,q5nc5
109,f,right ,q5nc5
110,f,right ,q5nc5
111,g,right ,q5nc5
112,g,see the buffalo ,q5nc5
113,f,mmhmm ,q5nc5
114,g,ah ,q5nc5
115,g,right right ,q5nc5
116,g,head down the right sand hand side of the paper ,q5nc5
117,g,and curve underneath the buffalo ,q5nc5
118,f,yeah ,q5nc5
119,f,right ,q5nc5
120,g,do you see a cattle ranch no ,q5nc5

125,g,away at the other side ,q5nc5
126,g,right ,q5nc5
127,g,you're heading to go under that but like on your way about halfway between the buffalo and the fort there's a wee blip in your line ,q5nc5
128,f,mmhmm ,q5nc5
129,g,like you're going over the top something and then coming back down and going under the fort ,q5nc5
130,f,yeah ,q5nc5
131,g,so just do that ,q5nc5
132,f,right ,q5nc5
133,f,and then go under the fort ,q5nc5

135,g,where are you now then ,q5nc5
136,f,i'm under the fort ,q5nc5
137,g,right ,q5nc5
138,g,you just want to curve up the left-hand side of the fort just curve a nice big curve round it ,q5nc5
139,f,mmhmm ,q5nc5
140,g,and that's it you're finished ,q5nc5
141,f,good ,q5nc5
0,g,right ,q4ec6
1,g,you go down to the bottom left corner to the left of the camera shop ,q4ec6
2,f,to the left of the camera shop ,q4ec6
3,g,yes ,q4ec6
4,f,to the bottom corner ,q4ec6
5,g,ehm ,q4ec6
6,g,y-- yeah eh er you have a parked van marked on your map underneath the camera shop ,q4ec6
7,f,no ,q4ec6
8,g,no ,q4ec6
9,g,well about an inch from the bottom of the page you sudden-- you go right and then up to the corner of the allotments to the left-hand side ,q4ec6
10,f,so go right underneath the camera shop at the bottom ,q4ec6
11,g,yes ,q4ec6
12,g,and then up ,q4ec6
13,f,and then up ,q4ec6
14,g,straight up ,q4ec6
15,f,the left-hand side of the allotments ,q4ec6
16,g,yes ,q4ec6
17,f,i stop at the top of the allotments ,q4ec6
18,g,yes ,q4ec6
19,g,and ,q4ec6
20,f,right ,q4ec6
21,g,you have a l-- a yacht club in the bottom right corner ,q4ec6
22,f,yes ,q4ec6
23,g,slightly to the left of that you have to draw a point on a level with the c-- the top of the camera shop and then draw a straight line from the corner of the allotments to that point ,q4ec6
24,f,so have you got a flight museum on your ,q4ec6
25,g,no ,q4ec6
26,f,no ,q4ec6
27,f,so i've got to go along from the allotments to the right ,q4ec6
28,g,yes ,q4ec6
29,f,and how far away from the yacht club ,q4ec6
30,g,it's on a l-- it's on a level with the cam-- the roof of the camera shop horizontally and vertically slightly to the left of the c-- yacht club ,q4ec6
31,f,uh-huh ,q4ec6
32,f,right ,q4ec6
33,g,you got that ,q4ec6
34,f,mmhmm ,q4ec6
35,g,then you go straight up and curve over the top of the disused monastery ,q4ec6
36,f,straight up right ,q4ec6
37,g,have you over th-- o-- are you eh curved over the monastery ,q4ec6
38,f,mmhmm above the monastery ,q4ec6
39,g,you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curve ,q4ec6
40,f,so it's right round the monastery ,q4ec6
41,g,yeah ,q4ec6
42,f,mmhmm ,q4ec6
43,g,then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden ,q4ec6
44,g,roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it ,q4ec6
45,f,s-- ,q4ec6
46,g,then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden ,q4ec6
47,f,mmhmm ,q4ec6
48,g,then to the right 'til the other side of the lef-- the alpine garden and straight up ,q4ec6
49,g,now have you got a youth hostel marked there ,q4ec6
50,f,no ,q4ec6
51,g,no ,q4ec6
52,g,well you go up about four inches from the alpine garden and then draw a line two inches to the right ,q4ec6
53,f,have you got parked van ,q4ec6
54,g,yes ,q4ec6
55,g,it's it's below the parked van ,q4ec6
56,f,uh-huh ,q4ec6
57,g,it's about it's below the level of the picket fence ,q4ec6
58,g,have you got that ,q4ec6
59,f,yeah ,q4ec6
60,g,it's about an inch below the level of the picket fence ,q4ec6
61,f,right ,q4ec6
62,f,uh-huh ,q4ec6
63,g,and then you go to your right ,q4ec6
64,f,underneath the parked van ,q4ec6
65,g,yes ,q4ec6
66,g,to appro-- to roughly about the middle of the parked van a line and that ,q4ec6
67,f,uh-huh ,q4ec6
68,g,and do you have a telephone box ,q4ec6
69,f,yeah ,q4ec6
70,g,well do ,q4ec6
71,g,you the next stage is you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-hand side of the youth hostel down to ,q4ec6
72,f,i don't have youth hostel ,q4ec6
73,g,oh right ,q4ec6
74,g,well from that point that i've just gone round ,q4ec6
75,f,mmhmm ,q4ec6
76,g,down to the it's slightly to the left of the telephone box 'cause there's ,q4ec6
77,f,so vertical ,q4ec6
78,f,have you got level crossing ,q4ec6
79,g,no ,q4ec6
80,f,no ,q4ec6
81,g,there's a v-- there's a hori-- horizontal line that goes under the telephone box ,q4ec6
82,f,uh-huh ,q4ec6
83,g,eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended at ,q4ec6
84,f,right ,q4ec6
85,f,right i've done that ,q4ec6
86,g,then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box ,q4ec6
87,f,mmhmm ,q4ec6
88,g,then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a ve-- a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake ,q4ec6
89,f,mmhmm ,q4ec6
90,f,so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake ,q4ec6
91,f,so i curve round that ,q4ec6
92,g,yes ,q4ec6
93,f,right ,q4ec6
94,f,to the middle of the east lake ,q4ec6
95,g,to a line approximately just it's below the m-- ,q4ec6
96,f,yeah uh-huh ,q4ec6
97,g,east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence ,q4ec6
98,f,mm right ,q4ec6
99,f,done that ,q4ec6
100,g,right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side ,q4ec6
101,f,mmhmm ,q4ec6
102,f,so sorry say that again ,q4ec6
103,g,on a l-- eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence ,q4ec6
104,f,mmhmm ,q4ec6
105,g,about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer m-- the left most part of east lake ,q4ec6
106,f,right ,q4ec6
107,f,actually touches the ,q4ec6
108,g,it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake ,q4ec6
109,f,no ,q4ec6
110,f,right ,q4ec6
111,f,think that's where it is ,q4ec6
0,g,right ready ,q7nc2

14,f,right ,q7nc2
15,g,say you know ,q7nc2
16,f,how far is that how far south before i make a camel's hump ,q7nc2
17,g,the nor-- ,q7nc2
18,g,just just on your way south make a little hump ,q7nc2
19,g,and go down about oh three inches ,q7nc2
20,f,like ,q7nc2

22,g,just like a wee little like a little hill ,q7nc2
23,f,aye ,q7nc2
24,f,but how-- how bi-- how long a one ,q7nc2
25,g,just like the well the three inch line going south should just be like a little just have a little a hump to ,q7nc2
26,f,a curve a curvy line ,q7nc2
27,g,it does ,q7nc2
28,g,pardon yeah yeah ,q7nc2
29,g,sort of j-- well well just with one but i d-- i guess it doesn't matter so just go down south about three inches ,q7nc2
30,f,right okay ,q7nc2

60,f,right okay that's done ,q7nc2
61,g,but so ,q7nc2
62,g,now we want to go um diagonally northeast and sort of avoid the obstacle on the right so you should be on the outside of that ,q7nc2
63,f,yeah ,q7nc2
64,f,have you got a name written on it ,q7nc2
65,f,that wee obstacle ,q7nc2

100,g,and then sort of slope down about two inches and approach the left of these trees ,q7nc2
101,f,right ,q7nc2
102,f,to sort of cut from above the trees to cut in to the left of them ,q7nc2
103,g,to to come in below ,q7nc2

209,g,and then to where the base ,q7nc2
210,g,ah your hands are much smaller than mine ,q7nc2
211,f,what way do you want me to trace round the fields it goes right round the fields like takes a right round the fields ,q7nc2
212,g,yeah you go right around the fields ,q7nc2
213,g,and then you go left again to the base of your thumb ,q7nc2
214,f,right okay right i'm just doing that now ,q7nc2
215,g,'cause it looks like it looks like a hand sort of well my thumb's a lot bigger than yours ,q7nc2

235,g,no ,q7nc2
236,g,just like leaving a wee space ,q7nc2
237,f,right okay ,q7nc2
238,g,in between ,q7nc2
239,g,and then ,q7nc2

241,f,well ,q7nc2
242,f,there's a it's li-- li-- there's a almost like a wee headland right where i'm coming down there's it's like a flat bit of the bay right and if you move to your left it's all like a headland jutting out into the bay like a a shallow curve ,q7nc2
243,g,you ,q7nc2
244,g,yeah ,q7nc2
245,f,going into the bay ,q7nc2
246,g,yeah ,q7nc2
247,g,just trace along that curve ,q7nc2
248,f,right ,q7nc2
249,g,'til you come to the next wee point ,q7nc2
250,f,right okay ,q7nc2
251,g,where it sort of 'cause then then like the bay drops down ,q7nc2
252,f,uh-huh ,q7nc2
253,g,so ,q7nc2
254,g,just where the bay drops down stop there ,q7nc2
255,f,right okay i've done that ,q7nc2
256,g,okay and now ,q7nc2
257,f,uh-uh ,q7nc2

260,g,do you have ,q7nc2
261,f,what ,q7nc2
262,g,directly to your left do you have like cliffs and with a meadow on top of it ,q7nc2
263,f,no ,q7nc2
264,f,i've got attractive cliffs at the bottom of th-- ,q7nc2
265,f,see where the bay goes down ,q7nc2
266,g,yeah ,q7nc2
267,f,it the it's at the bottom there ,q7nc2
268,g,and then do you have anything ahead of it on top of ,q7nc2
269,f,not above it no nothing ,q7nc2
270,g,that okay ,q7nc2
271,f,there's a big empty space so ,q7nc2
272,g,okay ,q7nc2

277,g,i have something that you don't then ,q7nc2
278,f,right okay ,q7nc2
279,g,but so 'cause there's another vast meadow about an inch up from the attractive cliffs ,q7nc2
280,f,right ,q7nc2
281,g,so ,q7nc2
282,g,we need to go in between the attractive cliffs and this meadow so like slope down to the ,q7nc2
283,f,so ,q7nc2
284,f,what about going across this drop in the bay then ,q7nc2
285,g,yeah ,q7nc2
286,g,so ,q7nc2
287,g,what you do go left at gentle slope 'til you're about a half an inch above the attractive cliffs and go straight to the left above them so a gentle slope down 'til the right of the attractive cliffs ,q7nc2
288,f,right ,q7nc2
289,f,and then just straight left ,q7nc2
290,g,yeah ,q7nc2
291,g,just straight left for about an inch and a half ,q7nc2
292,f,right i think i've done that right ,q7nc2
293,g,and then another gentle slope down to the left about an inch long ,q7nc2
294,f,yeah ,q7nc2
295,g,or inch and a half ,q7nc2
296,f,uh-huh ,q7nc2
297,f,i'm getting near the end of the edge of the paper though ,q7nc2
298,g,yeah ,q7nc2
299,g,ah okay oh are you ,q7nc2
300,f,yeah ,q7nc2
301,g,okay because alright s-- ,q7nc2
302,f,have you got a crashed spaceship down there ,q7nc2
303,f,just below the attractive cliffs ,q7nc2
304,g,no ,q7nc2
305,g,all i have is a chestnut tree ,q7nc2
306,f,no ,q7nc2
307,f,i've got a chestnut tree right i've got attractive cliffs and then und-- straight underneath that ,q7nc2
308,g,you have a spaceship ,q7nc2
309,f,ha i've got a chestnut tree right so d-- but on the left-hand side between the two that's where the spaceship is ,q7nc2
310,g,on the left of the chestnut tree ,q7nc2
311,f,yeah ,q7nc2
312,f,see see the attractive cliffs and chestnut tree are sort of in a straight well not really a straight line but one under the other ,q7nc2
313,g,yeah yeah ,q7nc2
314,g,yeah ,q7nc2
315,f,you've got a crashed space crashed spaceship on the left-hand side ,q7nc2
316,g,okay ,q7nc2
317,g,'cause that's where we're su-- is do you have a f-- an that's where we're supposed to finish ,q7nc2
318,f,oh right ,q7nc2
319,g,so ,q7nc2
320,g,what you do if you're at the edge of the paper just drop down about ,q7nc2
321,f,i'm not at the edge i've g-- i've got about an inch and a half to go i'm ,q7nc2
322,g,okay ,q7nc2
323,f,just above i've just come through the attractive cliffs ,q7nc2
324,g,mm ,q7nc2
325,f,bit ,q7nc2
326,g,oke-- okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the paper ,q7nc2
327,f,right ,q7nc2
328,g,and then you drop down about an inch and a half ,q7nc2
329,f,uh-huh ,q7nc2
330,g,then you go to the right about an inch ,q7nc2
331,g,and a little bloop up ,q7nc2
332,f,what ,q7nc2
333,f,right ,q7nc2
334,g,"then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an ""x"" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tree ",q7nc2
335,f,oh ,q7nc2
336,g,you're making me pick my nose ,q7nc2
337,f,well we we might be in di-- the chestnut trees might be in different position ,q7nc2
338,f,is it a bloop like a kind of round bit ,q7nc2
339,g,yeah just ,q7nc2
340,f,like what we did round the fields ,q7nc2
341,g,sort of but very very j-- ,q7nc2
342,f,earlier on ,q7nc2
343,g,no ,q7nc2
344,g,it's like it's so slight it's only like it's less than a quarter of an inch 'cause you just came to ,q7nc2
345,f,what to the left or to the right ,q7nc2
346,g,just straight up ,q7nc2
347,f,straight up ,q7nc2
348,f,no ,q7nc2
349,g,i guess it doesn't matter ,q7nc2
350,f,i'm coming right wait a minute ,q7nc2
351,f,i'm coming down the way right i've come across sort of diagonally in a curve past the cliff cliffs and i've dropped down about half an inch ,q7nc2
352,g,mmhmm ,q7nc2
353,f,just over half an inch three quarters of an inch right ,q7nc2
354,g,so how f-- how ,q7nc2
355,f,where do and i'm just above the spaceship right ,q7nc2
356,g,okay so ,q7nc2
357,f,so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've got ,q7nc2
358,g,is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree ,q7nc2
359,f,no ,q7nc2
360,f,it's just above the tree ,q7nc2
361,g,oh no you should be y-- ,q7nc2
362,f,it's above it's well my tree might be different than your tree ,q7nc2
363,g,okay ,q7nc2
364,g,well just just ,q7nc2
365,g,"go to the right about an inch and then draw an ""x"" and we'll be done ",q7nc2
366,f,right ,q7nc2
367,g,i got to see your map ,q7nc2
368,f,right ,q7nc2
369,g,okay ,q7nc2
370,f,okay ,q7nc2
371,f,it's great yeah ,q7nc2
372,f,i i it's probably nothing like what you said ,q7nc2
373,g,okay ,q7nc2
0,g,right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner ,q4ec4
1,f,right right ,q4ec4
2,f,the camera shop's ri-- directly below the start position right ,q4ec4
3,g,yes ,q4ec4
4,g,you move down to l-- past the left-hand side of the camera shop ,q4ec4
5,f,no right ,q4ec4
6,g,and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop ,q4ec4
7,f,no ,q4ec4
8,f,no-- it's just allotments to the eh right ,q4ec4
9,g,no ,q4ec4
10,f,and slightly below ,q4ec4
11,g,you move ,q4ec4
12,g,well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments ,q4ec4
13,f,and where do i stop ,q4ec4
14,g,stop just at the bot-- the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed ,q4ec4
15,f,right ,q4ec4
16,f,right ,q4ec4
17,g,then you move in an angle slo-- sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop ,q4ec4
18,f,so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the ,q4ec4
19,g,it's not marked on my map ,q4ec4
20,f,oh right ,q4ec4
21,f,ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically ,q4ec4
22,g,slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop ,q4ec4
23,f,right ,q4ec4
24,f,so you make an angle and that's a straight line ,q4ec4
25,g,a straight line yes ,q4ec4
26,f,right ,q4ec4
27,f,from there to just above the camera shop ,q4ec4
28,g,yeah ,q4ec4
29,g,approximately two thirds away t-- from the right-hand side of the page ,q4ec4
30,f,uh from the right-hand side of the page ,q4ec4
31,g,no sorry ,q4ec4
32,g,one third away from the right-hand side of the page ,q4ec4
33,f,right ,q4ec4
34,f,that's just below the flight museum ,q4ec4
35,f,okay ,q4ec4
36,g,well pu-- ,q4ec4
37,g,have you got yacht club marked bottom right corner ,q4ec4
38,f,yes uh-huh ,q4ec4
39,g,well it's just slightly to the left of the yacht club on a level with the camera shop roof ,q4ec4
40,f,okay ,q4ec4
41,f,and where do we go after that ,q4ec4
42,g,you turn straight up the page and make a straight line which curves over and around top of the disused monastery ,q4ec4
43,g,have you got that mark ,q4ec4
44,f,what on top of the monastery ,q4ec4
45,g,above the monastery ,q4ec4
46,f,and t-- uh right okay that's okay ,q4ec4
47,g,to the left up the to the right and then curves over to the left ,q4ec4
48,f,right ,q4ec4
49,f,so we're going from like above the allotments to just above the yacht club no just above but ehm about ,q4ec4
50,g,approximately three inches ,q4ec4
51,f,same level as the camera shop basically ,q4ec4
52,g,three four inches ,q4ec4
53,g,yeah ,q4ec4
54,f,and then eh from there going to disused monastery ,q4ec4
55,g,yes ,q4ec4
56,f,right ,q4ec4
57,g,curving around the top of the disused monastery ,q4ec4
58,f,yeah right ,q4ec4
59,f,right ,q4ec4
60,f,so curve around the disused monastery then where ,q4ec4
61,g,and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately li-- like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the gr-- the alpine garden ,q4ec4
62,f,right ,q4ec4
63,f,could you just say that again ,q4ec4
64,g,right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough ,q4ec4
65,f,right ,q4ec4
66,g,and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden ,q4ec4
67,f,right ,q4ec4
68,f,so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery ,q4ec4
69,g,no ,q4ec4
70,g,a curve poin-- going down the way uh ,q4ec4
71,f,that's what i mean ,q4ec4
72,f,i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically ,q4ec4
73,g,yes ,q4ec4
74,f,right ,q4ec4
75,f,and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden ,q4ec4
76,g,yeah ,q4ec4
77,g,you stop on a level with the m-- disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden ,q4ec4
78,f,right ,q4ec4
79,f,right ,q4ec4
80,g,then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden ,q4ec4
81,g,then you mak-- go right to the end of the alpine garden ,q4ec4
82,g,then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel ,q4ec4
83,f,there is no youth hostel ,q4ec4
84,g,then about three inches ,q4ec4
85,f,where was the youth hostel ,q4ec4
86,g,youth hostel was t-- upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically ,q4ec4
87,f,right ,q4ec4
88,f,right i think i know where it is ,q4ec4
89,f,right ehm where where would i be going after that ,q4ec4
90,g,after where ,q4ec4
91,f,after the this youth hostel ,q4ec4
92,g,after youth hostel ,q4ec4
93,g,you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical ,q4ec4
94,f,right ,q4ec4
95,f,eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going to ,q4ec4
96,g,the telephone box ,q4ec4
97,f,right okay uh right ,q4ec4
98,f,so i go up just below th-- just to below the parked van ,q4ec4
99,f,have you got a parked van ,q4ec4
100,g,no ,q4ec4
101,g,you go to about t-- two inches below the parked van ,q4ec4
102,f,right ,q4ec4
103,f,right ,q4ec4
104,f,and then from there ,q4ec4
105,g,you go ,q4ec4
106,f,so it's ,q4ec4
107,g,two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box ,q4ec4
108,f,right ,q4ec4
109,f,all right ,q4ec4
110,f,underneath the telephone telephone box ,q4ec4
111,g,yes ,q4ec4
112,f,right ,q4ec4
113,g,not directly underneath it ,q4ec4
114,f,ehm ,q4ec4
115,g,you're going to draw a s-- you're going to have to draw a straight line adding on to that that passes underneath the telephone box ,q4ec4
116,f,right right okay ,q4ec4
117,f,okay ,q4ec4
118,g,then there's a straight line going under the telephone box ,q4ec4
119,f,right ,q4ec4
120,g,and a vertical line going up the right-hand side of the telephone box ,q4ec4
121,f,and where does it go to ,q4ec4
122,g,it stops about level with the top of the telephone box ,q4ec4
123,g,then there's a sort of exponential curve that goes up to your right from that point and it starts to become vertical to the left of the telephone box on a l-- line left of the telephone box ,q4ec4
124,f,and where's it going to is it going to the level crossing ,q4ec4
125,g,it's going ,q4ec4
126,g,not marked on my map ,q4ec4
127,g,it's going to the right to the left of the thatched mud hut and ,q4ec4
128,f,i don't have a thatched mud hut ,q4ec4
129,g,no ,q4ec4
130,f,whe-- have you got an east lake ,q4ec4
131,g,yes ,q4ec4
132,g,it stops approximately th-- on a line through the middle of the east lake ,q4ec4
133,f,mm right ,q4ec4
134,f,ehm well i've got a level crossing just below the the the ehm east lake ,q4ec4
135,g,it'll probably mean go through that then ,q4ec4
136,f,through the level crossing ,q4ec4
137,f,ehm aren't we meant to eh avoid obstacles ,q4ec4
138,g,avoid them ,q4ec4
139,f,yeah ,q4ec4
140,g,right ehm ,q4ec4
141,f,i need to go ehm where where is it going is it going to eh eh parked van or some place ,q4ec4
142,g,ehm no ,q4ec4
143,f,eh where ,q4ec4
144,g,it's going to the right of the parked van underneath the lef-- the very left-hand point of the east lake ,q4ec4
145,f,right ,q4ec4
146,f,so it's between ehm ,q4ec4
147,g,it's on a level with the picket fence ,q4ec4
148,g,have you got that top left corner ,q4ec4
149,f,yeah i've got that ,q4ec4
150,g,the finish point is on a level with that underneath the most left point of the east lake ,q4ec4
151,f,right ,q4ec4
152,f,r-- i'll go round it the level crossing ,q4ec4
153,f,okay ,q4ec4
154,g,right ,q4ec4
155,f,is it a straight line or a curve ,q4ec4
156,g,it curves ,q4ec4
157,g,eh if the telephone box is there it curves up and then goes like that ,q4ec4
158,f,right ,q4ec4
159,g,from that's from seen from my point of view ,q4ec4
160,f,and that's from the right-hand side of the telephone box ,q4ec4
161,g,from the right-hand side of the telephone box it goes to the left-hand point ,q4ec4
162,f,right ,q4ec4
163,f,well i can't do an exponential so ,q4ec4
164,g,that's the path marked there ,q4ec4
165,f,i'll see what i can do ,q4ec4
166,f,right ,q4ec4
167,g,that you at the finish point ,q4ec4
168,f,i'm just at the eh left-hand bottom corner of the east lake ,q4ec4
169,g,the left-hand bot-- corner ,q4ec4
170,g,you go just about an inch to your left ,q4ec4
171,f,right ,q4ec4
172,g,and that's the finish point ,q4ec4
173,g,on a level with the picket fence ,q4ec4
174,f,right ,q4ec4
175,f,on a level with the picket fence ,q4ec4
0,g,okay ehm ,q5nc7
1,g,your start is above the caravan park ,q5nc7
2,f,uh-huh ,q5nc7
3,g,now ,q5nc7
4,g,you've to head down ehm on the left of the caravan park right beside the edge of the page ,q5nc7
5,f,okay ,q5nc7
6,g,right down to ,q5nc7
7,f,at a slant or ,q5nc7
8,g,no ,q5nc7
9,g,just straight down ,q5nc7
10,f,straight down right straight down ,q5nc7
11,g,very near about an inch away from the bottom of the page ,q5nc7
12,f,ehm over the picket fence ,q5nc7
13,g,ehm don't know ,q5nc7

28,f,erm right along or to an angle did you say ,q8ec4
29,g,well i ,q8ec4
30,g,imagine there's like a ehm a line like horizontal ,q8ec4
31,g,right ,q8ec4
32,f,yeah ,q8ec4
33,g,and then let's say f-- ph thirty degrees up the way ,q8ec4
34,g,so it's at an angle ,q8ec4
35,f,up the way ,q8ec4
36,f,up the way ,q8ec4
37,g,so it's like an angle like that ,q8ec4

44,g,right ,q8ec4
45,f,how does it go from there ,q8ec4
46,g,down below that ,q8ec4
47,g,down below that ,q8ec4
48,g,to about halfway down the middle of the lake ,q8ec4
49,f,halfway ,q8ec4
50,f,what's that halfway what ,q8ec4
51,g,the b-- see where the bottom of the the bottom line of the lake ,q8ec4

24,g,well if you could just imagine that's above the ravine on a horizontal line with burnt forest ,q4ec5
25,f,right ,q4ec5
26,g,okay ,q4ec5
27,g,and go horizontally towards your right above the ravine ,q4ec5
28,f,right ,q4ec5
29,f,and where do i stop ,q4ec5
30,g,stop ah midway between the ravine and the pine grove ,q4ec5
31,f,right okay ,q4ec5
32,g,okay ,q4ec5
33,g,right ,q4ec5
34,g,now i want you to take that line go down towards pine grove just stop beside the writing pine grove ,q4ec5
35,f,right ,q4ec5
36,f,right with a vertical line straight down ,q4ec5
37,g,uh-huh ,q4ec5
38,f,right ,q4ec5
39,g,oh right and do you have any obstructions underneath the pine grove ,q4ec5
40,f,well there's an avalanche just to the right of it ehm and there's er a concealed hideout ,q4ec5
41,g,okay ,q4ec5
42,g,i want you to get to the concealed hideout ,q4ec5
43,f,just below there ,q4ec5
44,g,so ehm ,q4ec5
45,g,is the avalanche to the right or the left of the pine grove ,q4ec5
46,f,it's to the right ,q4ec5
47,g,to the right okay ,q4ec5
48,f,and just slightly below as well ,q4ec5
49,g,uh-huh ,q4ec5
50,g,well keep to the left-hand side of the avalanche draw the line downwards towards th-- slightly towards the right okay i want you to go really close to the avalanche but don't go past it and then keep that line going vertically downwards until you get just above the top of the concealed hideout ,q4ec5
51,f,right ,q4ec5
52,f,eh are you trying to az-- avoid an obstacle here ,q4ec5
53,g,i'm trying to avoid your avalanche but there's nothing here ,q4ec5
54,f,so does it oh how does it how does the line go does it go just like a straight line between just below pine grove to the hi-- concealed hideout or ,q4ec5
55,g,if you can draw that straight line without ,q4ec5
56,f,i can yes ,q4ec5
57,g,without ,q4ec5
58,f,mmhmm ,q4ec5
59,g,okay right that's fine ,q4ec5
60,g,without getting in the avalanche that's fine ,q4ec5
61,f,right ,q4ec5
62,f,s-- and eh i want to be just above ,q4ec5
63,g,just above the the peak of the concealed hideout ,q4ec5
64,f,right right ,q4ec5
65,g,okay that's fine right ,q4ec5
66,g,now i want you to go round ehm to your left of the concealed hideout ,q4ec5
67,g,is there a boat house ,q4ec5
68,f,no ,q4ec5
69,f,oh there's a boat house on the eh ,q4ec5
70,g,uh-huh but ,q4ec5
71,f,to the right and down ,q4ec5
72,g,i wa-- ehm i've got one to the left ,q4ec5
73,g,okay ,q4ec5
74,f,uh-huh right ,q4ec5
75,g,ehm so if you can imagine there's a boat house there so it's kind of like in the middle of the whole map ,q4ec5
76,f,right ,q4ec5
77,f,is it in the wee bulge eh just above crane bay ,q4ec5
78,g,it's above that directly above that ,q4ec5
79,f,right okay ,q4ec5
80,g,okay if you can imagine that's there i want you to go i want you to draw it round concealed hideout come to the to the right of concealed hideout ,q4ec5
81,g,okay ,q4ec5
82,f,right ,q4ec5
83,f,eh to the right of concealed hi-- hideout ,q4ec5
84,g,mmhmm ,q4ec5
85,g,so take that line that have you drawn and ,q4ec5
86,f,is this is just to the left is this a right on the map or a le-- a right o-- ,q4ec5
87,f,okay ,q4ec5
88,g,the right of concealed hideout ,q4ec5
89,f,right ,q4ec5
90,f,and that ,q4ec5
91,g,and then continue the line underneath concealed hideout so you're drawing to the right and then underneath concealed hideout ,q4ec5
92,f,and underneath to the left do you mean like going from left to right underneath the concealed l-- hi-- hideout ,q4ec5
93,g,from right to left uh-huh ,q4ec5
94,f,from right to left right okay ,q4ec5
95,f,so i come round the the concealed hideout ,q4ec5
96,g,yeah ,q4ec5
97,f,from right to left ,q4ec5
98,f,right okay ,q4ec5
99,g,and then stop ,q4ec5
100,f,and then i go do i go down to that bulge yeah ,q4ec5
101,g,do you see the bulge ,q4ec5
102,g,it's like a it's an incline that goes down right the c-- the the coastline of crane bay comes up and it peaks at the top to the right of concealed to the left sorry of concealed hideout ,q4ec5
103,g,okay you see that ,q4ec5
104,g,and then it falls again there's a d-- a big dent in crane bay just above where it it actually says crane bay ,q4ec5
105,f,yes i see that right ,q4ec5
106,g,okay ,q4ec5
107,g,well i want you to draw the line from where you are just now and then if you could make it meet the coastline where that dent is ,q4ec5
108,f,right okay ,q4ec5
109,g,and i want you to follow it until it peaks again ,q4ec5
110,f,right i see you right ,q4ec5
111,f,so you're drawing a to a straight line between those two eh peaks ,q4ec5
112,g,well i want i-- you to actually follow it ,q4ec5
113,f,oh right ,q4ec5
114,f,to the right to curve round right ,q4ec5
115,g,to bay ,q4ec5
116,g,yeah uh-huh ,q4ec5
117,f,okay ,q4ec5
118,f,so eh i'm going for a straight line from concealed hideout to the first eh crest ,q4ec5
119,g,yeah ,q4ec5
120,f,and then do a curved line ,q4ec5
121,f,right okay ,q4ec5
122,g,yeah ,q4ec5
123,g,until you come to the next peak there ,q4ec5
124,f,right ,q4ec5
125,g,okay right ,q4ec5
126,g,from now on you're going to go generally in a diagonal from right to left ,q4ec5
127,g,okay ,q4ec5
128,g,but i want you to draw above ,q4ec5
129,g,have you got pebbled shore ,q4ec5
130,f,yes ,q4ec5
131,g,well on my map above directly above pebbled shore there's coconut palm ,q4ec5
132,f,there's no such thing on this map ,q4ec5
133,g,okay ,q4ec5
134,g,so i want you to draw from right to left in a in a diagonal passing the top of pebbled shore okay can you do that and just stop at the end of pebbled shore there ,q4ec5
135,f,right okay ,q4ec5
136,f,so it's just a diagonal from that first crest to above pebbled shore ,q4ec5
137,g,uh-huh ,q4ec5
138,g,can you make it can you make that a diagonal sink downwards a bit ,q4ec5
139,f,what you you mean curve ,q4ec5
140,g,can make it curve dow-- curve downwards a bit ,q4ec5
141,f,right so to make it curve above pebbled shore ,q4ec5
142,g,but s-- ,q4ec5
143,g,yeah ,q4ec5
144,g,but still so that it's more following the the li-- the coastline again okay but coming away to go ,q4ec5
145,f,where where is the object eh you're trying to avoid ,q4ec5
146,g,it's a-- above pebbled shore ,q4ec5
147,f,it's ,q4ec5
148,g,to the right of pebbled shore just above ,q4ec5
149,f,above and to the right right i understand now i-- ,q4ec5
150,f,is it ehm how far roughly is it from the the coastline ,q4ec5
151,g,ehm the same distance away as pebbled shore is away from the lower coastline ,q4ec5
152,f,right okay ,q4ec5
153,f,right so curve right ,q4ec5
154,g,okay ,q4ec5
155,g,what have you got below pebbled shore ,q4ec5
156,f,there's eh washed stones ,q4ec5
157,g,okay ,q4ec5
158,g,i don't have that ,q4ec5
159,g,i want ehm you see where the flagship is ,q4ec5
160,f,yes ,q4ec5
161,g,uh-huh okay ,q4ec5
162,g,in a horizontal line from the flagships okay imagine a line drawn there that's the finishing line about a centimetre away from the coastline ,q4ec5
163,g,okay ,q4ec5
164,f,to the left ,q4ec5
165,g,uh-huh ,q4ec5
166,g,and i want you to draw from where you are just now in a semicircular shape until you come horizontal with a line ,q4ec5
167,f,mmhmm ,q4ec5
168,g,beside the flagship can you do that avoiding whatever you've got underneath the pebbled shore ,q4ec5
169,f,ehm does this does this curve follow th-- ,q4ec5
170,g,that's towards the right ,q4ec5
171,g,towards the left sorry ,q4ec5
172,f,does the curve follow the coastline or does it f-- go the opposite way ,q4ec5
173,g,f-- it goes towards the edge of the paper ,q4ec5
174,f,right ah right ,q4ec5
175,f,and the the f-- the finish is just to the is between ,q4ec5
176,g,it is to the left of the flagship ,q4ec5
177,f,the eh the flagship and the edge of the paper ,q4ec5
178,g,uh-huh ,q4ec5
179,g,about a centimetre away from the coastline ,q4ec5
180,f,right okay so ,q4ec5
181,f,okay ,q4ec5
182,g,okay ,q4ec5
0,g,okay ,q7nc3
1,g,have you found can you go to the start c-- ehm position please ,q7nc3
2,f,mm ,q7nc3
3,g,there's a black cross ,q7nc3
4,f,yeah ,q7nc3
5,g,right just below the start position there should be the site of a forest fire ,q7nc3
6,f,mm ,q7nc3
7,g,have you got that ,q7nc3
8,f,yeah ,q7nc3
9,g,if you could start from the black cross and go slightly to the left and then straight down ehm past the s-- to the side of the left-hand side of the forest fire the site of forest fire and keep going sort of down very near to the edge of the page until you come to a picnic site ,q7nc3
10,g,have you got a picnic site ,q7nc3
11,f,no i don't have that ,q7nc3
12,g,mm have you got an adventure playground ,q7nc3

14,f,that's above to the right ,q7nc3
15,g,right okay ,q7nc3
16,g,could you keep don't don't go anywhere towards the p-- adventure playground just now ,q7nc3
17,f,okay ,q7nc3
18,g,jus-- could you go down from maybe the bottom you're still on the very very left-hand side of the page could you go down from the the writing that says site of forest fire ,q7nc3
19,f,yeah ,q7nc3
20,g,down about four inches on the side of the page just continue your path ,q7nc3
21,f,okay ,q7nc3
22,g,okay ,q7nc3
23,g,right ,q7nc3
24,g,and then can you stop about an inch from the bottom of the page ,q7nc3
25,f,okay ,q7nc3
26,g,and turn turn to the right hand side and go along maybe for about two inches just horizontally ,q7nc3
27,f,okay ,q7nc3
28,f,okay ,q7nc3
29,g,and then i'd like you to turn upwards to the direction of the adventure playground ,q7nc3
30,f,okay ,q7nc3
31,f,okay ,q7nc3
32,g,okay put and then just sort of skim along the edge of the adventure playground ,q7nc3
33,f,okay ,q7nc3
34,g,and you should see there's a sort of climbing frame ,q7nc3
35,f,mm ,q7nc3
36,g,c-- come up to the top of the climbing frame and then turn right ,q7nc3
37,f,okay ,q7nc3
38,f,okay ,q7nc3
39,g,right okay ,q7nc3
40,g,now ,q7nc3
41,g,have you got there's a 'til you're just sort of right tu-- if you turn right and continue along horizontally for about six inches ,q7nc3
42,f,okay ,q7nc3
43,g,you should have above you a granite quarry ,q7nc3
44,f,okay w-- ,q7nc3
45,g,have you got this granite quarry ,q7nc3
46,f,yeah ,q7nc3
47,f,it's way above though ,q7nc3
48,g,yeah so that's okay it's supposed to be ,q7nc3
49,g,you're sort of you're horizon-- you're level with the adventure playground but you have to right wait a minute go along about six inches from the adventure playground and then directly up ,q7nc3
50,f,okay ,q7nc3
51,f,mmhmm ,q7nc3
52,f,okay ,q7nc3
53,g,towards towards the granite quarry ,q7nc3
54,f,okay ,q7nc3
55,g,and sort of turn right wait a minute you just sort of the right-hand side of the granite quarry can you go right up above the granite quarry ,q7nc3
56,f,yeah ,q7nc3
57,g,and then back down again ,q7nc3
58,g,i don't have you got any obstacles in your way ,q7nc3
59,f,ah right like directly diagonal from the adventure playground i've privately owned fields about four inches under the granite quarry ,q7nc3
60,g,mmhmm mmhmm ,q7nc3
61,g,but you haven't gone through them have you ,q7nc3
62,f,no ,q7nc3
63,g,okay ,q7nc3
64,g,right so ,q7nc3
65,g,if you continue going right up above the granite quarry ,q7nc3
66,f,okay ,q7nc3
67,g,you should come to a train crossing ,q7nc3
68,g,do you have the train crossing ,q7nc3
69,f,ah yeah ,q7nc3
70,f,but it's up on the far left of my paper so ,q7nc3
71,g,oh ,q7nc3
72,g,oh right ,q7nc3
73,g,there's t-- actually two on mine so if you uh you should have a granite quarry and then a waterfall well that's what i've got on my map ,q7nc3
74,f,yeah ,q7nc3
75,f,i have a waterfall to the left of the granite quarry ,q7nc3
76,g,yeah ,q7nc3
77,g,but on this map there's a train crossing ,q7nc3
78,g,so if you could come down you go up above the granite quarry and then back down again but not too far ,q7nc3
79,g,otherwise you'll pass through the train crossing in my map ,q7nc3
80,f,okay ,q7nc3
81,g,so if you keep going along just about half an inch below the waterfall and right up to the left han-- no ,q7nc3
82,f,right ,q7nc3
83,f,what i did at the top of the granite quarry was i made a right ,q7nc3
84,g,mmhmm ,q7nc3
85,g,oh no ,q7nc3
86,f,for around two inches ,q7nc3
87,f,or what should i have done ,q7nc3
88,g,you should have gone to the left ,q7nc3
89,f,okay ,q7nc3
90,g,sorry towards the waterfall sorry ,q7nc3
91,f,that's okay ,q7nc3
92,f,so then okay ,q7nc3
93,f,how far above the granite quarry should i go ,q7nc3
94,g,about couple of about half a centimetre ,q7nc3
95,f,and then go left ,q7nc3
96,g,yeah ,q7nc3
97,g,sort of over the granite quarry in the direction of the waterfall ,q7nc3
98,g,just if you keep about two centimetres below the w-- the writing that says waterfall ,q7nc3
99,f,do you okay keep below it ,q7nc3
100,g,mmhmm ,q7nc3
101,g,not too far though ,q7nc3
102,f,okay ,q7nc3
103,g,"and then if you go up to the ""w"" of the waterfall and then straight up just about couple of centime-- no a centimetre a-- away f-- to the left of wa-- the ""w"" of waterfall straight up to the top of the waterfall ",q7nc3
104,f,okay i see ,q7nc3
105,g,and when you get to the top of the waterfall oh you should just go up above the waterfall about five centimetres two inches ,q7nc3
106,f,okay ,q7nc3
107,g,and you should be n-- n-- you should be near to the train crossing in ,q7nc3
108,f,mm ,q7nc3
109,g,and cornfields ,q7nc3
110,f,yeah ,q7nc3
111,g,but don't just stay where you are just now ,q7nc3
112,g,now if you go to the ,q7nc3
113,g,if you can look back quickly at the granite quarry you should see a fallen cairn ,q7nc3
114,f,yeah ,q7nc3
115,g,i want you to go wh-- from where you are to just below the fallen cairn t-- ,q7nc3
116,f,okay ,q7nc3
117,g,just go past underneath it though ,q7nc3
118,f,okay ,q7nc3
119,g,and then once you-- once you're past it can you turn back up to the left past and go up up the way towards the limestone cliffs keeping on the left-hand side of the limestone cliffs ,q7nc3
120,f,should i after the fallen cairns ,q7nc3
121,g,uh-huh ,q7nc3
122,f,should i just be going up straight ,q7nc3
123,g,erm sort of veer veer a bit to the left ,q7nc3
124,f,okay ,q7nc3
125,f,and then up above ,q7nc3

135,f,you are ,q7nc3
136,g,okay ,q7nc3
137,g,well sort of keep to the left of the lion country and keep going up the way for about from the fallen cairn oh no about five centimetres just keep going up past the lion country ,q7nc3
138,f,okay ,q7nc3
139,g,and you should come to an east lake ,q7nc3
140,f,okay ,q7nc3
141,g,just go along skim along the bottom of the east lake to the finish and that's you ,q7nc3
142,f,to the finish where's the finish ,q7nc3
143,g,oh no between the cornfields and the east lake ,q7nc3
144,f,oh okay ,q7nc3
145,g,about just directly in the middle and that's you ,q7nc3
146,f,okay ,q7nc3
147,g,okay ,q7nc3
0,g,your start and you've got a diamond mine beside it ,q1nc5
1,f,uh-huh ,q1nc5
2,g,and you've got a fast flowing river over the other corner ,q1nc5
3,f,uh-huh ,q1nc5
4,g,right ,q1nc5
5,g,so if you just circle round the diamond mine ,q1nc5
6,f,right ,q1nc5
7,g,and have you got a graveyard in the middle no of the fast flowing river and the diamond mine ,q1nc5
8,f,no i don't ,q1nc5
9,g,no ,q1nc5
10,f,am i am i going round the diamond mine and down ,q1nc5
11,g,just ,q1nc5
12,g,down no ,q1nc5
13,g,you're circling you're going down no just circling round it so that you end up with a horizontal line below the diamond mine you know circling round it ,q1nc5
14,f,oh right okay ,q1nc5
15,f,so i'm starting off going down and then right ,q1nc5
16,g,uh-huh ,q1nc5

18,g,that's the way you're going ,q1nc5
19,f,okay ,q1nc5
20,g,and it ,q1nc5
21,f,just right underneath the diamond mine ,q1nc5
22,g,mmhmm ,q1nc5
23,f,okay ,q1nc5
24,g,right and er ,q1nc5
25,g,i've got on my map i've got a graveyard in between them both exactly in between ,q1nc5
26,f,mmhmm ,q1nc5
27,g,right so ,q1nc5
28,g,if you imagine ,q1nc5
29,f,mmhmm ,q1nc5
30,g,that you have to circle round the graveyard you know to the right-hand side below and then round ,q1nc5
31,g,get that ,q1nc5
32,f,ehm ,q1nc5
33,g,so you're like really going just about vertically along to the right you know to where you imagine the graveyard is and you're going round it but then you're you're going round it then you're ehm going to your right above the fast flow-- the fast flowing river ,q1nc5
34,f,am i am i going round and above the graveyard ,q1nc5
35,g,no ,q1nc5
36,g,you're going below the graveyard and above the fast flowing river ,q1nc5
37,f,right ,q1nc5
38,f,right okay ,q1nc5
39,g,if you can imagine that know ,q1nc5
40,f,right ,q1nc5
41,f,and where do i go when i get to the the river ,q1nc5
42,g,ah you're circling round it ,q1nc5
43,g,right ,q1nc5
44,f,right okay ,q1nc5
45,g,and then you're going vertically downwards ,q1nc5
46,f,right ,q1nc5
47,g,have you got ,q1nc5
48,g,have you got an apache camp ,q1nc5
49,f,uh-huh ,q1nc5
50,g,right ,q1nc5
51,g,well you're going downwards and but you're going to the left of the apache camp so you're going vertically downwards and then your line's sort of going left ,q1nc5
52,f,right ,q1nc5
53,g,and have you got a carved wooden pole no ,q1nc5
54,f,no i don't ,q1nc5
55,g,that's just that's in the cen-- in the centre of the page just above the ac-- apache camp though ,q1nc5
56,f,okay ,q1nc5
57,g,so ,q1nc5
58,g,you have to avoid that so you're going down sort of ,q1nc5
59,f,h-- hold on i'm i'm kind of above the apache camp at the moment ,q1nc5
60,g,uh-huh ,q1nc5
61,f,right ,q1nc5
62,f,and wh-- ,q1nc5
63,g,well ,q1nc5
64,g,you've to go past that ,q1nc5
65,f,right ,q1nc5
66,g,towards the centre of the page though ,q1nc5
67,f,right ,q1nc5
68,g,to ,q1nc5
69,f,just a straight line along ,q1nc5
70,g,no ,q1nc5
71,g,this is a curve a forty-five degree line i would say you know like you're from the the bottom of the fast flowing river ,q1nc5
72,g,right ,q1nc5
73,g,you're maybe coming down about an inch and a half vertically ,q1nc5
74,f,mmhmm ,q1nc5

130,f,right ,q1nc5
131,g,you're curving round 'til nearly you're nearly up at the flat rocks ,q1nc5
132,f,okay ,q1nc5
133,g,your curve's going a way up ,q1nc5
134,f,right ,q1nc5
135,g,right ,q1nc5

38,g,okay ,q1nc4
39,f,uh-huh ,q1nc4
40,g,about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're ab-- ,q1nc4

362,g,right ,q1nc3
363,f,uh-huh ,q1nc3
364,g,so you know how you've curved round ,q1nc3
365,f,mmhmm ,q1nc3
366,g,where the buffalos are ,q1nc3
367,g,you've you'll have to you know ,q1nc3

370,f,right i know where you are have to bump ,q1nc3
371,g,in your route ,q1nc3

373,g,uh mmhmm ,q1nc3
374,f,that's the end ,q1nc3
375,g,bump in your route and then round to the fort ,q1nc3
376,g,and the finish is above the fort maybe about an inch above the fort ,q1nc3
377,f,so on what side on the left or right ,q1nc3
378,g,on the left-hand side ,q1nc3
379,f,on the left-hand side of the fort ,q1nc3

381,f,so i've got to go right round the f-- ,q1nc3
382,g,on the left-hand side you've ,q1nc3
383,f,i've got to go right round the fort ,q1nc3
384,g,uh-huh ,q1nc3
385,f,right ,q1nc3
386,g,you know you've got to go below the fort ,q1nc3
387,f,uh-huh ,q1nc3
388,f,right round to about the is it near the carved wooden pole then the finish ,q1nc3
389,g,yes ,q1nc3
390,g,it's in line with the carved wooden pole except it's an inch from the ,q1nc3
391,f,the fort ,q1nc3
392,g,no ,q1nc3
393,g,an inch from the left-hand side of the page ,q1nc3
394,f,right uh-huh i'm there ,q1nc3
395,g,is that you ,q1nc3
396,f,i-- but is the finishing point at the fort ,q1nc3
397,g,no ,q1nc3
398,g,it's above ,q1nc3
399,f,right above the fort och i've just got a general gist there ,q1nc3
400,g,'bout an inch above the fort ,q1nc3
401,f,right okay ,q1nc3
402,g,that's it ,q1nc3
403,f,right ,q1nc3
0,f,right ,q2ec5
1,g,right mm ,q2ec5
2,g,have you got a missionary camp down the bottom ,q2ec5
3,f,yes ,q2ec5
4,g,then that's where your start is ,q2ec5
5,f,mmhmm ,q2ec5
6,g,right ,q2ec5
7,f,that's right ,q2ec5
8,g,okay well ,q2ec5
9,g,you need to go ehm travel left about an inch and then go down along the side of the missionary camp so you're going downwards just running along parallel to it ,q2ec5
10,f,right okay ,q2ec5
11,g,okay ,q2ec5
12,g,down so that you're about an inch above the bottom of the map ,q2ec5
13,f,right ,q2ec5
14,g,okay ,q2ec5
15,g,now ,q2ec5
16,g,you have you got a some gorillas over on the left ,q2ec5
17,f,no ,q2ec5
18,f,i've got a banana tree though ,q2ec5
19,g,alright that's probably ,q2ec5
20,g,do you think that's probably the same ,q2ec5
21,f,yeah that's probably about it ,q2ec5
22,g,mm yeah ,q2ec5
23,g,so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree ,q2ec5
24,f,right er we'll probably have to take it down a wee bit further for for that ,q2ec5
25,g,right okay ,q2ec5
26,f,right nothing else kind of down there ,q2ec5
27,g,right ,q2ec5
28,f,and i want to stop directly below ,q2ec5
29,g,yeah ,q2ec5
30,g,well ,q2ec5
31,g,actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map ,q2ec5
32,f,mmhmm ,q2ec5
33,f,right that's okay ,q2ec5
34,g,okay ,q2ec5
35,g,so you then go upwards about ,q2ec5
36,g,and then have you got a rope bridge ,q2ec5
37,f,yeah ,q2ec5
38,g,right ,q2ec5
39,g,you need to run up vertically until you become parallel with the rope bridge ,q2ec5
40,f,oh i've taken it over much further than that i'm kind of almost at the edge of the page so ,q2ec5
41,g,ah right ,q2ec5
42,f,is it okay is it safe enough to head diagonally across ,q2ec5
43,g,yeah ,q2ec5
44,g,if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge ,q2ec5
45,f,right okay ,q2ec5
46,g,and then you you're walking across the rope bridge so your line will stop and then start coming out at the other side of the rope bridge ,q2ec5
47,f,right fine ,q2ec5
48,g,okay ,q2ec5
49,g,down about an inch so you come you've come off the rope bridge and you drop down about an inch ,q2ec5
50,f,right ,q2ec5
51,f,erm i don't know if i can do that without going in the river actually ,q2ec5
52,g,oh yeah ,q2ec5
53,g,i for-- yeah there's a river isn't there ,q2ec5
54,g,well ,q2ec5
55,g,if you just take it so that you're running alongside the river ,q2ec5
56,f,just right along the edge of the river ,q2ec5
57,g,yeah so you need to run alongside the river for about um three or four inches ,q2ec5
58,f,right okay ,q2ec5
59,g,and then ,q2ec5
60,g,you have got a waterfall on the right-hand side ,q2ec5
61,f,yeah ,q2ec5
62,g,well then um ,q2ec5
63,g,just 'til when you're about ehm level with the b-- with the bottom of the waterfall ,q2ec5
64,f,mmhmm ,q2ec5
65,g,then you go straight upwards alongside the waterfall ,q2ec5
66,f,right ,q2ec5
67,g,have you got some lost steps there ,q2ec5
68,f,erm yes i have ,q2ec5
69,f,but quite a bit above maybe something like five inches or something above ,q2ec5
70,g,oh no th-- ,q2ec5
71,g,these these are in the middle ,q2ec5
72,g,have you got some fallen pillars ,q2ec5
73,f,yes ,q2ec5
74,g,okay ,q2ec5
75,g,well ,q2ec5
76,g,where are you at the moment ,q2ec5
77,f,um d-- just stop beside the waterfall that's right over on the right-hand side ,q2ec5
78,g,yeah ,q2ec5
79,g,right you need to go upwards until you're level with the fallen pillars ,q2ec5
80,f,right okay ,q2ec5
81,g,okay ,q2ec5
82,f,fine ,q2ec5
83,g,and then imagine that you had ,q2ec5
84,g,you see the lost steps at the top ,q2ec5
85,f,yes ,q2ec5
86,g,if you imagine that they were there just where you've stopped ,q2ec5
87,f,mmhmm ,q2ec5
88,g,so you need to loop over the top of them as if you were going over something ,q2ec5
89,g,so you you're going u-- ,q2ec5
90,f,right ,q2ec5
91,f,so which way am i heading then left or right ,q2ec5
92,g,right ,q2ec5
93,g,you're going left towards the fallen pillars ,q2ec5
94,f,right okay ,q2ec5
95,g,okay ,q2ec5
96,g,if you go over the ,q2ec5
97,f,so i'll let out a well i'll allow for being above the fallen pillars yeah ,q2ec5
98,g,uh-huh yeah ,q2ec5
99,g,and then you need to head back down again to go underneath the fallen pillars ,q2ec5
100,f,right okay ,q2ec5
101,f,mmhmm ,q2ec5
102,f,i've got flamingoes down here with a ,q2ec5
103,g,okay ,q2ec5
104,g,yeah ,q2ec5
105,f,quite a small gappy bit ,q2ec5
106,g,right ,q2ec5
107,g,then if you go down and underneath what ,q2ec5
108,g,i w-- i haven't got anything but i think that's where your flamingoes are ,q2ec5
109,f,um well ,q2ec5
110,f,they're just maybe an inch below and an inch to the left of the fallen pillars ,q2ec5
111,g,right okay ,q2ec5
112,g,so if you then go right underneath the flamingoes ,q2ec5
113,f,right okay ,q2ec5
114,g,and and then up right up towards th-- ,q2ec5
115,g,have you got ancient ruins ,q2ec5
116,f,er i've got a ruined city abo-- maybe half the distance to the top from there ,q2ec5
117,g,yeah okay ,q2ec5
118,g,right yeah that's right ,q2ec5
119,g,so you go right up to the ehm ruins ,q2ec5
120,f,uh-huh ,q2ec5
121,f,just keeping on the edge of the page yeah ,q2ec5
122,g,and then you ,q2ec5
123,g,keeping on the edge ,q2ec5
124,g,maybe a bit in towards a bit heading towards the ruins ,q2ec5
125,f,right okay ,q2ec5
126,g,and then have you got some stones at the left-hand s-- on the left-hand side right in the top left-hand corner ,q2ec5

128,g,okay ,q2ec5
129,f,i've got a rock fall kind of fairly near to the centre ,q2ec5
130,g,ah right ,q2ec5
131,f,er in between ,q2ec5
132,g,well you you know where the ruins are ,q2ec5
133,f,yeah ,q2ec5
134,g,you've got where are you now ,q2ec5
135,f,i'm just to the to the left-hand side of them ,q2ec5
136,g,right okay ,q2ec5
137,g,now you need to go straight up so that you're now about two inches from the top of the map and about ,q2ec5
138,f,right ,q2ec5
139,f,just just level with the side ,q2ec5
140,g,yes ,q2ec5
141,g,and about three inches from the side ,q2ec5
142,f,right okay ,q2ec5
143,g,okay ,q2ec5
144,f,right up to the top ,q2ec5
145,g,so that no ,q2ec5
146,g,about two inches from the top ,q2ec5
147,f,right okay ,q2ec5
148,g,okay ,q2ec5
149,g,and then ,q2ec5
150,g,that's it and then right have you got a white mountain ,q2ec5
151,f,yeah ,q2ec5
152,g,right ,q2ec5
153,g,you need to just run vertically along and then to get as if you were climbing the mountain and going back down the other side so you go along to the white mountain ,q2ec5
154,f,right okay ,q2ec5
155,g,up ,q2ec5
156,f,up on the left-hand side just go up up the side ,q2ec5
157,g,up th-- up the left yeah ,q2ec5
158,g,up the side of the mountain and then down the other side ,q2ec5
159,f,right okay ,q2ec5
160,g,then ,q2ec5
161,g,have you got a soft furnishings furnishings store ,q2ec5
162,f,no ,q2ec5
163,f,i've got nothing round about there 'part from the lost steps and directly below the mountain i've got gazelles ,q2ec5
164,g,okay ,q2ec5
165,f,or i have the gazelles anyway ,q2ec5
166,g,well ,q2ec5
167,g,you need to then ,q2ec5
168,g,right ,q2ec5
169,g,you're at the bottom of the mountain now ,q2ec5
170,f,erm ,q2ec5
171,f,erm am i going underneath it ,q2ec5
172,g,okay ,q2ec5
173,g,yeah ,q2ec5
174,g,you need to go underneath it but by about an inch underneath ,q2ec5
175,f,loo-- ,q2ec5
176,f,right okay ,q2ec5
177,g,okay ,q2ec5
178,g,and then ,q2ec5
179,g,now now you should be level with the beginning of the mountain so you should be level with the left-hand side of the mountain ,q2ec5
180,f,oh right i see what you mean ,q2ec5
181,g,y-- you're going back on yourself ,q2ec5
182,f,yeah well i've got a rock fall there so i can't ,q2ec5
183,g,right ,q2ec5
184,f,i've got a rock fall just across from that so ,q2ec5
185,g,oh okay ,q2ec5
186,g,um well so you're now you should be underneath the mountain ,q2ec5
187,f,yeah ,q2ec5
188,g,okay ,q2ec5
189,g,now you need to drop straight down towards the gazelles ,q2ec5
190,f,right ,q2ec5
191,f,coming in at the top of them ,q2ec5
192,g,that's right ,q2ec5
193,g,and then go round the bottom of the gazelles ,q2ec5
194,f,on the left-hand side ,q2ec5
195,g,and head off to the right-hand side ,q2ec5
196,g,so you go under the gazelles yeah ,q2ec5
197,f,right ,q2ec5
198,f,i've got a big space here which presumably ,q2ec5
199,g,that's where we're finishing soon here finishing here ,q2ec5
200,f,you've got something in ,q2ec5
201,f,right okay ,q2ec5
202,g,so you're underneath the gazelles ,q2ec5
203,f,right ,q2ec5
204,g,yeah ,q2ec5
205,g,straight off to the right about three inches and then we stop ,q2ec5
206,f,right ,q2ec5
207,g,okay so you're going in the opposite direction to the ancient ruins ,q2ec5
208,f,right ,q2ec5
209,g,yeah ,q2ec5
210,g,okay that's it ,q2ec5
211,f,is that it ,q2ec5
212,f,right fine ,q2ec5
0,g,right ,q2ec4
1,g,at the very top of the page there's a cross ,q2ec4
2,f,yep ,q2ec4
3,g,do you have a diamond mine just below it ,q2ec4
4,f,mmhmm ,q2ec4
5,g,about an inch to your right draw a line straight down ,q2ec4
6,f,right ,q2ec4
7,f,c-- start from the cross yeah ,q2ec4
8,g,'til it's abo-- 'til it's an inch below the diamond mine ,q2ec4
9,g,right ,q2ec4
10,g,do you have a wagon-- ,q2ec4
11,f,it's directly down yeah ,q2ec4
12,g,yeah ,q2ec4
13,g,do you have a a wagon wheel just to the right of the the diamond mine ,q2ec4
14,f,mm no i haven't got any wagon wheel ,q2ec4
15,g,what's the f-- next thing to its right ,q2ec4
16,f,to the right i've got eventually a cactus ,q2ec4
17,g,you don't have a rift valley ,q2ec4
18,f,oh i've got a rift valley above that ,q2ec4
19,g,yeah okay ,q2ec4
20,f,y-- you've got the rift valley right up at the top right-hand side ,q2ec4
21,g,you're drawing your line down ,q2ec4
22,f,mmhmm ,q2ec4
23,g,underneath draw a line to your right and straight along at a slight angle rising up towards the back of the corner of the page ,q2ec4
24,f,towards the right-hand corner ,q2ec4
25,g,yeah ,q2ec4
26,f,ehm that's going to take me f-- pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid that ,q2ec4
27,g,right ,q2ec4
28,f,hang on hang on right ,q2ec4
29,f,an inch to the right of the diamond mine ,q2ec4
30,g,yeah ,q2ec4
31,f,yeah and then straight down to an inch below it ,q2ec4
32,g,should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be okay ,q2ec4
33,f,yeah ,q2ec4
34,g,and then go st-- straight along to my right which is your right as well go straight along to the right ,q2ec4
35,f,okay ,q2ec4
36,f,to right to the edge of the page ,q2ec4
37,g,no ,q2ec4
38,g,to about halfway to page about four inches off before the page ,q2ec4
39,f,er right okay ,q2ec4
40,f,that takes me to ,q2ec4
41,g,then go s-- up to almost the very top of the page ,q2ec4
42,f,okay ,q2ec4
43,g,right ,q2ec4
44,g,and then to your right again ,q2ec4
45,f,okay hang on ,q2ec4
46,g,well but ,q2ec4
47,f,have you got the rift valley there ,q2ec4
48,f,'cause i've got the rift valley right up in that r-- top right-hand corner ,q2ec4
49,g,yeah ,q2ec4
50,g,you're going to actually go through the rift valley ,q2ec4
51,g,like the rift valley's like a half moon ,q2ec4
52,f,yeah ,q2ec4
53,g,you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley ,q2ec4
54,f,right ,q2ec4
55,f,go through the centre ,q2ec4
56,f,i'll just take it up and go through the centre yeah ,q2ec4
57,g,yeah ,q2ec4
58,g,"like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a ""u"" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the ""u"" as though you were going if you know what i mean ",q2ec4
59,f,right okay ,q2ec4
60,f,erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line up ,q2ec4
61,g,yeah below ,q2ec4
62,g,and then like into the rift valley ,q2ec4
63,f,okay right ,q2ec4
64,g,and right through ,q2ec4
65,f,i'll have to t-- i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detour ,q2ec4
66,f,right ,q2ec4
67,f,and just take it straight through towards the top of the page ,q2ec4
68,g,straight through yeah ,q2ec4
69,f,alright there we go ,q2ec4
70,g,and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way ,q2ec4
71,g,do you know what i mean ,q2ec4
72,f,not quite ,q2ec4
73,g,right ,q2ec4
74,g,you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right ,q2ec4
75,f,was i ,q2ec4
76,g,yeah ,q2ec4
77,g,above the rift valley ,q2ec4
78,g,you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint ,q2ec4
79,f,right ,q2ec4
80,f,mm that's not where i am now ,q2ec4
81,f,right so where hang on right so ,q2ec4
82,g,"your rift valley is ""u""-shaped yeah ",q2ec4
83,f,yeah ,q2ec4
84,f,in a c-- like as the two ends are pointing up towards top of the page ,q2ec4
85,g,yeah ,q2ec4
86,f,right ,q2ec4
87,f,and i was supposed to start above it there and come down through it ,q2ec4
88,g,yes ,q2ec4
89,f,well ,q2ec4
90,f,i've done it back to front but never mind right ,q2ec4
91,f,eh so i should now be below it ,q2ec4
92,g,yeah ,q2ec4
93,g,through the midpoint ,q2ec4
94,g,below your rift valley about four inches down do you have rocks ,q2ec4
95,f,yeah ,q2ec4
96,g,and do you have a stone creek ,q2ec4
97,f,erm no ,q2ec4
98,f,i've got the rocks i've got like two rocks ,q2ec4

101,g,yeah ,q2ec4
102,g,i've got that ,q2ec4
103,f,but i haven't got anything else round about that area ,q2ec4
104,g,you've got nothing to like the left of it ,q2ec4
105,f,er right over i've got rapids about three inches across from the rocks ,q2ec4
106,g,well i've got a stone creek there ,q2ec4
107,g,see in between ,q2ec4
108,g,you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rocks ,q2ec4
109,f,thr-- through the centre of the two rocks ,q2ec4
110,g,no ,q2ec4
111,g,no not sorry ,q2ec4
112,g,i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch ,q2ec4
113,f,right okay ,q2ec4
114,f,so is it ,q2ec4
115,f,well okay alright i think i've got this ,q2ec4
116,f,the first part of this is a total state ,q2ec4
117,g,do you have white water ,q2ec4
118,f,er well that'll be the rapids ,q2ec4
119,g,yeah that's true ,q2ec4
120,g,and you don't have a stone creek above your white water ,q2ec4
121,f,no i've got ,q2ec4
122,g,or a swamp to its left ,q2ec4
123,f,i've got the swamp ,q2ec4
124,f,and like directly above the rapids i've got a diamond mine ,q2ec4
125,g,to its left ,q2ec4
126,g,well that's a a stone c-- ss ,q2ec4
127,f,but you know right right back at the start ,q2ec4
128,g,oh no aye yeah ,q2ec4
129,g,you don't have like above the the rapids to its s-- slightly to its right you don't have a stone creek ,q2ec4
130,f,nope ,q2ec4
131,g,no well ,q2ec4
132,g,take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just like ,q2ec4
133,f,am i going above or below here ,q2ec4
134,f,at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rocks ,q2ec4
135,g,above ,q2ec4
136,f,so where's where do i go from there ,q2ec4
137,g,right okay ,q2ec4
138,g,right round the white water or right round the rapids ,q2ec4
139,f,taking it round from the top or ,q2ec4
140,g,from the top ,q2ec4
141,g,but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone creek ,q2ec4
142,f,right okay ,q2ec4
143,f,right ,q2ec4
144,f,so i'm now at the top left-hand corner of the rapids ,q2ec4
145,g,right okay ,q2ec4
146,g,come down come straight down to below that like j-- a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like s-- straight down but like ,q2ec4
147,f,oh i see what you mean yeah ,q2ec4
148,g,in like length further down from that on the page ,q2ec4
149,f,have you got a manned fort below the rapids ,q2ec4
150,g,no ,q2ec4
151,f,'cause i've got that interrupting er like dir-- almost directly below it slightly to the left i've got a manned fort ,q2ec4
152,g,you got another stone creek ,q2ec4
153,f,eh oh right ,q2ec4
154,g,and stone slabs ,q2ec4
155,f,yeah it's right the way down below the manned fort ,q2ec4
156,f,have you not got anything in between the rapids and the stone creek down at the bottom ,q2ec4
157,g,no ,q2ec4
158,g,well yeah ,q2ec4
159,g,slightly to its right there's some stone slabs ,q2ec4
160,f,yeah no in right in between the two of those i've got a manned fort ,q2ec4
161,g,no ,q2ec4
162,g,how far down's the manned fort ,q2ec4
163,f,er about two inches maybe two and a half ,q2ec4
164,g,take it further down go right under the manned go under your manned fort and between your stone creek ,q2ec4
165,f,the stone creek and the stone slabs ,q2ec4
166,g,no ,q2ec4
167,g,go r-- go down under your manned fort and then ,q2ec4
168,f,which way do you want me to go round the r-- left or the right-hand side of that ,q2ec4
169,g,go round the left-hand side ,q2ec4
170,f,right okay ,q2ec4
171,g,and then ,q2ec4
172,g,when you get to the b-- when you get below it go up towards your ha-- outlaws' hideout and sort of take the line s-- sloping up so it's like going straight up towards the outlaws' hideout or it's going close to the hideout it's like you're so you're going to the other side of the page ,q2ec4
173,f,right so ,q2ec4
174,f,it's a diagonal across the page towards that ,q2ec4
175,g,yeah ,q2ec4
176,f,that sounds a bit drastic ,q2ec4
177,f,right ,q2ec4
178,g,right below your outlaws' hideout a good bit below do you have a noose ,q2ec4
179,f,yeah ,q2ec4
180,f,have you got a gold mine there as well just ,q2ec4
181,g,no ,q2ec4
182,f,just to below and to the right of the outlaws' hideout i've got a gold mine ,q2ec4
183,g,no i've got nothing ,q2ec4
184,f,i'm going to be quite wealthy i've got all the mines ,q2ec4
185,g,do you have a swan pond ,q2ec4
186,f,erm no ,q2ec4
187,g,no ,q2ec4
188,g,do you have a saloon bar ,q2ec4
189,f,er i've got a saloon bar right down on the left-hand side ,q2ec4
190,g,head for that and we'll be okay ,q2ec4
191,g,no ehm see the outlaws' hideout ,q2ec4
192,f,short cut ,q2ec4
193,f,yeah ,q2ec4
194,g,you're right up beside that ,q2ec4
195,f,mmhmm i'm ,q2ec4
196,f,ju-- well i've got it at the moment i'm slightly below it but ,q2ec4
197,g,you've got a gold mine a gold mine you got a gold mine below that ,q2ec4
198,f,yeah ,q2ec4
199,g,far below it ,q2ec4
200,f,erm ,q2ec4
201,g,directly below it ,q2ec4
202,f,not directly below it ,q2ec4
203,f,"just just below the ""u"" if you take it down from the hideout er that that's just that's just at the left-hand side ",q2ec4
204,g,aye ,q2ec4
205,g,that'll be where my s-- that'll be where my stone labs ,q2ec4
206,g,that'll be where my stone slabs are ,q2ec4
207,f,but are your stone slabs not kind of at the other side of that ,q2ec4
208,g,i would imagine ,q2ec4
209,f,'cause my stone slabs are like maybe what two and a half inches below and to the left ,q2ec4
210,g,aye right okay ,q2ec4
211,g,so you're saying they're it's to the right then this thing ,q2ec4
212,f,the gold mine is ,q2ec4
213,g,right above the noose ,q2ec4
214,f,mm aye directly above the noose that's a better description ,q2ec4
215,g,okay ,q2ec4
216,g,well-- ,q2ec4
217,g,from where that line is that you've drawn go straight down 'til you pass the noose and you're passing the noose like on its right-hand side by a wee bit ,q2ec4
218,f,on its right-hand side ,q2ec4
219,g,if you know what i mean ,q2ec4
220,g,yeah ,q2ec4
221,f,so that's like towards the edge of the paper here ,q2ec4
222,g,mmhmm ,q2ec4
223,f,right there we go ,q2ec4
224,f,i've come right down below that ,q2ec4
225,g,yeah ,q2ec4
226,g,then you don't have anything else down like ,q2ec4
227,f,i've got the saloon bar and i've got the stone creek directly across to the left of the noose er but i've got nothing else in that area at all ,q2ec4
228,g,uh-huh ,q2ec4
229,g,right ,q2ec4
230,f,you know like below that i should say i mean in the m-- in the middle and to b-- above them and the stone slabs ,q2ec4
231,g,okay ,q2ec4
232,g,right ,q2ec4
233,g,you know how the like on line with the saloon bar ,q2ec4
234,f,mmhmm ,q2ec4
235,g,about two inches along i've got a swans pond ,q2ec4
236,f,right ,q2ec4
237,f,so i've to avoid that ,q2ec4
238,g,you want to avoid that ,q2ec4
239,g,so ,q2ec4
240,f,so go above it ,q2ec4
241,g,need to go go up above it ,q2ec4
242,g,and then down and under the saloon bar to the finish ,q2ec4
243,f,phoar ,q2ec4
244,g,is that you ,q2ec4
245,f,that's it yeah ,q2ec4
246,g,yee-ha ,q2ec4
247,g,okay ,q2ec4
248,g,home boy let's see you done ,q2ec4
249,f,what the first bit of that was a total disaster ,q2ec4
250,g,he'll probably kill me here ,q2ec4
251,f,'cause i came through the rift valley the wrong way i was supposed to come from the top and go down 'til like down through it ,q2ec4
252,g,yeah ,q2ec4
253,f,'cause i well i came from underneath don't know what i was doing down there ,q2ec4
0,g,right ehm eh ,q1nc2
1,g,the start is down at the bottom ,q1nc2
2,g,i-- d-- do you just have a plain bit of paper ,q1nc2
3,f,no ,q1nc2
4,f,i've got er w-- mountains ,q1nc2
5,g,oh the right ,q1nc2
6,g,see the have you got a stony desert down at the bottom right-hand corner ,q1nc2
7,f,yes ,q1nc2
8,g,well ,q1nc2
9,g,the start is just just above that ,q1nc2
10,f,it's just above that ,q1nc2
11,f,yeah i know ,q1nc2
12,f,th-- that's marked on my map as well ,q1nc2
13,g,right ,q1nc2
14,g,ehm right ,q1nc2
15,g,we'll be working our way ehm up to the top and then back kind of down to the middle where the finish is ,q1nc2
16,g,ehm from the start you go along past the stony desert and down ,q1nc2
17,f,ehm so you're going right ,q1nc2
18,g,no ehm ,q1nc2
19,f,the stony desert is below the start ,q1nc2
20,g,yeah ,q1nc2
21,g,right ,q1nc2
22,g,and we're going left from that and kind of round round left past the stony desert and down until you're kind of level with the bottom of the stony desert ,q1nc2
23,f,right ,q1nc2
24,f,so i-- i'm going left ,q1nc2
25,g,uh-huh ,q1nc2
26,f,and how far left ,q1nc2
27,g,left from the start and y-- just just kind of round the outside of the desert you know right round the outline and then keep going down until you're kind of level with the stony desert ,q1nc2
28,f,but just round the outline of the desert ,q1nc2
29,g,yeah ,q1nc2
30,f,right right ,q1nc2
31,g,right ,q1nc2
32,g,and you're down to the level of the bottom if you run your finger along the bottom of the stony desert ,q1nc2
33,f,right ,q1nc2
34,g,right ,q1nc2

220,g,a kind of forty-five degree line about an inch and a half down kind of sloping ,q1nc2
221,f,right ,q1nc2
222,g,and you should be more to the left-hand side of the page now ,q1nc2

230,g,right that's okay ,q1nc2
231,g,and just after you've gone down your slope do another short line about an inch to your left just a straight line along ,q1nc2
232,f,right ,q1nc2
233,g,and there's some hot wells above this ,q1nc2
234,g,no ,q1nc2

248,g,uh-huh ,q1nc2
249,f,well ,q1nc2
250,f,if i go down an inch i can't 'cause i'll go right through a hot spring i'll need to go further along ,q1nc2
251,g,oh ,q1nc2
252,f,i'll just take the line further along to the left ,q1nc2

264,f,through mm-hmm ,q1nc2
265,g,but it goes up quite far it goes up goes up to about ehm ,q1nc2

267,g,ehm ,q1nc2
268,f,what have i to do ,q1nc2
269,g,wait a minute ,q1nc2

278,f,vertical line ,q1nc2
279,g,up quite high it'll go up to about the top third of the page sloping slightly at the end of your line to the right ,q1nc2
280,f,what so it's going up vertically and then sloping ,q1nc2
281,g,sloping just at the end ,q1nc2
282,g,at the right and you should be just about the top third of the page ,q1nc2
283,f,ehm no ,q1nc2
284,g,no ,q1nc2

298,g,level to the top of the mountain ,q1nc2
299,g,right ,q1nc2

35,f,right ,q7ec8
36,g,you've got that point do you want to mark a point there ,q7ec8
37,f,right ,q7ec8
38,f,there's ,q7ec8
39,g,right ,q7ec8
40,g,and you go from the start ,q7ec8
41,f,so you've ,q7ec8
42,g,so about you ,q7ec8
43,f,carpenter house from ,q7ec8
44,g,start and you do a curve about half a centimetre from the haystack down to the point ,q7ec8
45,f,down to the point just at the side of the carpenter's house ,q7ec8
46,g,yeah ,q7ec8
47,f,so just curving round down it like that ,q7ec8
48,g,just under the start ,q7ec8
49,g,no ,q7ec8
50,g,it's just under the start the point just under start and just under carpenter's house ,q7ec8
51,f,oh ,q7ec8
52,f,right ,q7ec8
53,g,so you're it's it's going just it's eventually going to end up just below the start line but it's half a centimetre under the carpenter's house ,q7ec8
54,f,half a centimetre under the carpenter's house right ,q7ec8
55,g,so ,q7ec8
56,f,so we're down below the carpenter's house about half a centimetre ,q7ec8
57,g,on the level ,q7ec8
58,g,yeah ,q7ec8
59,g,but across below the start ,q7ec8
60,g,see what i mean ,q7ec8
61,f,oh away round here below the start ,q7ec8
62,g,yeah ,q7ec8
63,g,so it's that's the level you're going to ,q7ec8
64,f,ah right ,q7ec8
65,f,"so it sort of curves round like that backwards ""c"" as you've said ",q7ec8
66,g,it's not ,q7ec8
67,g,it's just to the le-- it's to the left of the haystack it's just a really shallow thing ,q7ec8
68,f,doesn't sound like what i've got ,q7ec8
69,g,right ,q7ec8
70,g,you sti-- ,q7ec8
71,g,right ,q7ec8
72,g,we'll start again then ,q7ec8
73,g,you've got the start line right ,q7ec8
74,f,this is a good one ,q7ec8
75,g,and you've eh ,q7ec8
76,g,well ,q7ec8
77,g,you're going to end up directly below the start line ,q7ec8
78,g,okay ,q7ec8
79,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
80,f,so down below ,q7ec8
81,g,down below start line ,q7ec8
82,f,mm ,q7ec8
83,g,now ,q7ec8
84,g,you want to ,q7ec8
85,g,the point below the start line is level with about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house ,q7ec8
86,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
87,g,yeah ,q7ec8
88,f,right okay ,q7ec8
89,g,so you've got about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house draw a line across to below the start line ,q7ec8
90,f,right ,q7ec8
91,g,right ,q7ec8
92,f,drawn that if ,q7ec8
93,f,it's across ,q7ec8
94,g,well don't draw a line draw a point there sorry ,q7ec8
95,g,okay ,q7ec8
96,g,and you want to ,q7ec8
97,f,right ,q7ec8
98,f,i've started ,q7ec8
99,f,so from the start i'm going what direction ,q7ec8
100,g,you're going down towards the haystack ,q7ec8
101,f,down towards the haystack ,q7ec8
102,g,and you're missing the l-- haystack on the left by about half a centimetre ,q7ec8
103,f,on the left ,q7ec8
104,f,on the left ,q7ec8
105,g,on the left of the haystack yeah ,q7ec8
106,f,so i'm coming down past the left ,q7ec8
107,g,uh it's it's just a shallow ,q7ec8
108,g,yeah ,q7ec8
109,g,a shallow curve to that point down there ,q7ec8
110,f,uh-huh right okay ,q7ec8
111,g,right ,q7ec8
112,g,you want to go about an an inch to the right towards the carpenter's house ,q7ec8
113,f,an inch to the right right ,q7ec8
114,g,and then you want to go up ,q7ec8
115,f,up ,q7ec8
116,g,yeah ,q7ec8
117,g,you want eh green bay ,q7ec8
118,g,have you got green bay no right at the top ,q7ec8
119,f,green bay ,q7ec8
120,g,no ,q7ec8
121,f,no ,q7ec8
122,g,well you want to go up ,q7ec8
123,f,so you're going up p-- on the right-hand side of the hi-- haystack ,q7ec8
124,g,yeah you're d-- well let me see i'll tell you in a minute ,q7ec8
125,g,see the carpenter's house ,q7ec8
126,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
127,g,you've got the left-hand side of the roof ,q7ec8
128,f,right ,q7ec8
129,g,well you've got about an inch from the top of that just less than an inch ,q7ec8
130,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
131,g,and you mark a point there ,q7ec8
132,f,right ,q7ec8
133,g,right ,q7ec8
134,g,and join up the two points ,q7ec8
135,f,so you've gone th-- start down to shallow curve round the haystack and along to that point ,q7ec8
136,g,yeah ,q7ec8
137,g,yeah ,q7ec8
138,g,that's directly below the start ,q7ec8
139,g,yeah ,q7ec8
140,f,below the s-- directly below the start ,q7ec8
141,g,mm ,q7ec8
142,f,no ,q7ec8
143,g,no ,q7ec8
144,g,right ,q7ec8
145,g,from the beginning again ,q7ec8
146,g,right ,q7ec8
147,f,i think you're murdered ,q7ec8
148,g,you're going directly below the start but you're taking a curve that just misses the haystack ,q7ec8
149,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
150,g,it's just a really really sh-- shallow curve ,q7ec8
151,f,yeah ,q7ec8
152,g,right you've got that ,q7ec8
153,f,you're going so you're going d-- you're going down your star-- your starting point ,q7ec8
154,g,you've got that in ,q7ec8
155,g,you're going starting down ,q7ec8
156,f,you just go down curve round the bottom of the haystack ,q7ec8
157,g,and then you curve round the other way and you come to the bottom jus-- ,q7ec8
158,f,and you you come to the the roof a point where the roof of the carpenter's house left-hand side ,q7ec8
159,f,an inch above it ,q7ec8
160,g,well ,q7ec8
161,g,right ,q7ec8
162,g,from the start you're starting directly below the start point is where you want to go that well make that the first move ,q7ec8
163,g,you got that you got that it's shallow curve ,q7ec8
164,f,right ,q7ec8
165,f,shallow curve i've got ,q7ec8
166,f,i go down just and curve round the haystack ,q7ec8
167,g,well not round ,q7ec8
168,g,you want to finish below the starting point you go down you curve past you curve past the haystack ,q7ec8
169,f,so just a wee ,q7ec8
170,g,"it's like a an inverted ""c"" ",q7ec8
171,f,so i'm curving back like ,q7ec8
172,g,"it's like a ""c"" the wrong way round ",q7ec8
173,f,well i'm just curving back in ,q7ec8
174,g,yeah ,q7ec8
175,g,you're coming round to besi-- to below the start point which is also on a level below the carpenter's house that's to tell you where to stop ,q7ec8
176,f,all right ,q7ec8
177,f,so i'm actually i'm starting here and i'm finishing ,q7ec8
178,g,directly below start ,q7ec8
179,f,so it's just a wee shallow curve ,q7ec8
180,g,aye ,q7ec8
181,f,well i'll have to miss the blacksmith i've got a blacksmith's right okay that's ,q7ec8
182,g,that's you ,q7ec8
183,g,okay so you should just be about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house right ,q7ec8
184,f,a lot of rubbing scribbling going on here ,q7ec8
185,g,so you're half a centimetre below the carpenter's house you're on that level ,q7ec8
186,f,right ,q7ec8
187,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
188,f,right okay ,q7ec8
189,g,so you come across an inch from that point ,q7ec8
190,f,to the right ,q7ec8
191,g,to the right ,q7ec8
192,f,right ,q7ec8
193,g,and that's about an inch from the carpenter's house as well ,q7ec8
194,f,sec ,q7ec8
195,g,yeah ,q7ec8
196,f,yeah ,q7ec8
197,f,a wee bit further ,q7ec8
198,g,now ,q7ec8
199,g,you've got that point in then yes ,q7ec8
200,f,yeah ,q7ec8
201,g,so you want to go up ,q7ec8
202,g,you see the carpenter's house the roof the left-hand point of the roof ,q7ec8
203,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
204,f,so i want to go up to ,q7ec8
205,g,so you want to go up ,q7ec8
206,g,there's an inch above there right just maybe a bit less than an inch ,q7ec8
207,g,right ,q7ec8
208,f,right so a-- ,q7ec8
209,g,and you want to join that point those two points up and that's in a sort of thirty thirty degree angle or something like that ,q7ec8
210,f,so it's a sort of diagonal ,q7ec8
211,f,right okay i'll just ,q7ec8
212,g,right ,q7ec8
213,f,right ,q7ec8
214,g,just take it across about one two two inches it's slightly below and eastern ,q7ec8
215,g,right ,q7ec8
216,f,so one easter and we're going ,q7ec8
217,g,slightly below it two inches slightly below east it's about like ninety five degrees ,q7ec8
218,f,yeah ,q7ec8
219,g,right ,q7ec8
220,f,right ,q7ec8
221,g,and you've got the seven beeches ,q7ec8
222,f,yeah ,q7ec8
223,g,see you're about an inch above the seven beeches and about an inch to the left of the seven beeches that right ,q7ec8
224,f,no i'm not an inch above them ,q7ec8
225,f,to the carpent-- the carpenter's house an inch above the c-- top left corner is is on a level with that the top of the seven beeches so now i've gone down ,q7ec8
226,g,not an inch above them ,q7ec8
227,g,well you want to be about call it half an inch above the seven beeches ,q7ec8
228,f,right so i'll just ,q7ec8
229,g,right ,q7ec8
230,f,right okay ,q7ec8
231,g,"and from that point there you want to go about it's just off south to below the ""s"" in seven beeches ",q7ec8
232,f,just off south ,q7ec8
233,g,"it's southeast you want to be going right just below the ""s"" ",q7ec8
234,f,southeast mmhmm ,q7ec8
235,f,"right down that way just below the ""s"" wait a minute ",q7ec8
236,g,right ,q7ec8
237,f,"just below the ""s"" ",q7ec8
238,g,now eh ,q7ec8
239,g,you've got reclaimed fields down below that ,q7ec8
240,f,yeah i have ,q7ec8
241,g,down below ,q7ec8
242,g,well ,q7ec8
243,g,in between the seven beeches and the reclaimed fields i've got a chapel ,q7ec8
244,g,okay ,q7ec8
245,f,mm right ,q7ec8
246,f,i don't have that ,q7ec8
247,g,so ,q7ec8
248,g,"eh what i need to do is i need to go round it again an inverted ""c"" well it's no an inverted ""c"" it's li-- the other way about opposite ""c"" ",q7ec8
249,f,right ,q7ec8
250,g,and you need to go around it so eh ,q7ec8
251,f,so i sort of curve underneath seven beeches and round and then over to back to where i started from ,q7ec8
252,g,yeah so you ,q7ec8
253,g,the the actual point where you want to finish up is eh ,q7ec8
254,g,you see the the thick tree trunk on the right-hand side of the seven beeches ,q7ec8
255,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
256,f,the the the furthest right one ,q7ec8
257,g,so you want to finish ,q7ec8
258,g,yeah ,q7ec8
259,g,you want to finish about two inches below that ,q7ec8
260,f,right ,q7ec8
261,f,hold on to ,q7ec8
262,g,which is about h-- about a centimetre above the reclaimed fields ,q7ec8
263,g,does that make sense to you ,q7ec8
264,f,mm ,q7ec8
265,f,no ,q7ec8
266,f,the reclaimed fields are quite a distance away ,q7ec8
267,g,miles below it yeah ,q7ec8
268,f,aye ,q7ec8
269,g,well eh ,q7ec8
270,g,we'll call it just about two inches maybe a bit more call it two and a half inches below the tree trunk ,q7ec8
271,g,right ,q7ec8
272,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
273,g,and that's where you e-- want to finish up ,q7ec8
274,f,right ,q7ec8
275,g,"so to do that you'll need to take from the ""s"" and go round like from twelve o'clock to three o'clock ",q7ec8
276,f,yeah around ,q7ec8
277,g,and go out an inch ,q7ec8
278,f,and then ,q7ec8
279,f,and then back in again ,q7ec8
280,g,"from the ""s"" ",q7ec8
281,g,and then back into that point i told you ,q7ec8
282,f,yeah ,q7ec8
283,g,right ,q7ec8
284,f,got that ,q7ec8
285,g,s-- now ,q7ec8
286,g,you want to go like the end of a test tube like that way you want to go round the reclaimed fields like that ,q7ec8
287,g,have you got crane bay ,q7ec8
288,f,crane bay yeah ,q7ec8
289,g,"you see the m-- the most northerly tip above the ""b"" ",q7ec8
290,f,over the right yeah ,q7ec8
291,g,well ,q7ec8
292,g,"you want to come round the test round the reclaimed fields and the test tube sh-- sort of shape to about oh i don't know about an inch and a half above the ""b"" ",q7ec8
293,f,an inch ,q7ec8
294,f,"above the ""b"" ",q7ec8
295,g,"above the ""b"" yeah ",q7ec8
296,g,well ,q7ec8
297,f,so the point right ,q7ec8
298,g,no ,q7ec8
299,g,above the point sorry ,q7ec8
300,g,above the tip ,q7ec8
301,f,have you got whitewashed cottage ,q7ec8
302,g,no ,q7ec8
303,f,no ,q7ec8
304,f,so i'll have to miss that ,q7ec8
305,f,so ,q7ec8
306,f,if i come round in my curve and then i'm going along and then curving back round the same way ,q7ec8
307,g,yeah ,q7ec8
308,g,so the shape will be you'll be going east and then you'll be going down ,q7ec8
309,f,"a kind of inverted in a ""s"" a backwards ""s"" ",q7ec8
310,g,it's not ,q7ec8
311,g,well prob-- ,q7ec8
312,f,sort of ,q7ec8
313,g,it's just like that shape you want to do so you're going east and then you're going that curve and then you're going west until you're above that ,q7ec8
314,g,tip ,q7ec8
315,f,ah well ,q7ec8
316,f,"the whole thing in together like from the seven beeches round it's like an ""c"" and then and it's like a normal ""c"" sort of ",q7ec8
317,f,right i'll try and an inch and a half above there i'll have to draw it a bit s-- squint ,q7ec8
318,f,so i'm so i'm coming down on the right-hand the left-hand side of the reclaimed fields ,q7ec8
319,g,yeah ,q7ec8
320,f,and i've sort of s-- curved round to about there ,q7ec8
321,g,so you've got you've gone round the reclaimed fields ,q7ec8
322,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
323,g,and you're about an inch and a half above the tip the northern-most tip ,q7ec8
324,f,yeah about an inch ,q7ec8
325,g,now ,q7ec8
326,g,you want to go south down to that northern-most tip ,q7ec8
327,f,right ,q7ec8
328,g,right ,q7ec8
329,g,just off to the left-hand side of it ,q7ec8
330,g,okay ,q7ec8
331,f,right ,q7ec8
332,g,and you want to follow the contours of the bay round to the first ,q7ec8
333,g,well you know how it it sort of goes down in a curve ,q7ec8
334,f,uh-huh ,q7ec8
335,g,and then you get a southern a dead south it goes almost due south ,q7ec8
336,f,yeah ,q7ec8
337,g,well you want to follow the contours round to that point ,q7ec8
338,f,just skirt it along ,q7ec8
339,f,right ,q7ec8
340,f,i'm just ready to go south ,q7ec8
341,g,right ,q7ec8
342,g,so now ,q7ec8
343,g,have you got vast meadow and attractive cliff really close ,q7ec8
344,f,no ,q7ec8
345,f,i've got attractive cliffs which are round ,q7ec8
346,g,right ,q7ec8
347,g,well you want to go ,q7ec8
348,g,see where it goes di-- due south ,q7ec8
349,f,uh-huh ,q7ec8
350,g,and then it almost goes due west ,q7ec8
351,f,yeah ,q7ec8
352,g,well you want to do a straight line about a centimetre you want yeah you've got that point come down the due south and come across the west ,q7ec8
353,f,so skirting skirting along ,q7ec8
354,g,yeah ,q7ec8
355,g,no eh ,q7ec8
356,f,just straight line ,q7ec8
357,g,just a cen-- you want to do a centimetre above d-- the western-most tip right and draw a straight line from where you've stopped now ,q7ec8
358,g,you know when y-- ,q7ec8
359,f,uh-huh so it's right ,q7ec8
360,f,so it's just like a straight line from the south that bit there where it goes due south to about a centimetre above ,q7ec8
361,g,that's right ,q7ec8
362,f,right ,q7ec8
363,g,so it's about that sort of angle ,q7ec8
364,f,uh-huh ,q7ec8
365,g,now ,q7ec8
366,g,"you want to go due west until you're above the ""a"" in attractive cliffs ",q7ec8
367,f,right ,q7ec8
368,g,and then take it down about about the same angle as you took from the south to the west tip ,q7ec8
369,g,take that down to the bottom just on the same level as attractive cliffs so you're doing down that angle and it's about an inch long shall we say ,q7ec8
370,f,right ,q7ec8
371,f,right ,q7ec8
372,g,right you got that ,q7ec8
373,g,now ,q7ec8
374,g,in here you've got something to miss out haven't you ,q7ec8
375,f,crashed spaceship ,q7ec8
376,g,crashed spaceship ,q7ec8
377,g,so you want to go west of the crashed space the crashed spaceship ,q7ec8
378,f,right over to its west ,q7ec8
379,g,you want over to its west ,q7ec8
380,f,almost to the edge of the paper ,q7ec8
381,g,yeah down the edge of the paper ,q7ec8
382,f,right ,q7ec8
383,f,just just past it ,q7ec8
384,g,to just ,q7ec8
385,g,to the level of a chestnut tree ,q7ec8
386,f,yeah ,q7ec8
387,g,when you get to chestnut tree curve round and go to about half an inch from the bottom of the chestnut tree ,q7ec8
388,f,top ,q7ec8
389,f,half an inch from the bottom ,q7ec8
390,g,right ,q7ec8
391,f,so i curve round oh so i'm on its left-hand side and i'm out about half an inch bef-- bottom ,q7ec8
392,g,yeah ,q7ec8
393,g,you go up about half the trunk of the chestnut tree to the dimple in the chestnut tree ,q7ec8
394,g,you see the dimple in the chestnut tree ,q7ec8
395,f,the dimple uh ,q7ec8
396,g,halfway up the trunk just before the ,q7ec8
397,f,aye ,q7ec8
398,g,the branches start ,q7ec8
399,f,the branches ,q7ec8
400,f,right okay ,q7ec8
401,g,you've got that's only about like a centimetre long ,q7ec8
402,f,so ,q7ec8
403,g,and that's your finish point ,q7ec8
404,f,mmhmm ,q7ec8
405,f,so i've taken my cur-- i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a point ,q7ec8
406,g,about half an inch ,q7ec8
407,f,above ,q7ec8
408,g,no ,q7ec8
409,g,you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree ,q7ec8
410,f,yeah ,q7ec8
411,g,and you s-- then you go due north ,q7ec8
412,f,oh right ,q7ec8
413,f,i've go to the bo-- i go to the base of the tree ,q7ec8
414,g,from there you c-- half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk ,q7ec8
415,f,curve around ,q7ec8
416,g,all the way up the tree trunk basically to the stop at the ,q7ec8

167,g,there that's the finish ,q2ec7
168,f,is that that's the end right ,q2ec7
0,g,ehm right ,q1nc1
1,g,you start at the caravan park ,q1nc1
2,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
3,g,right ,q1nc1
4,g,ehm if you go down about three inches down uh-huh ,q1nc1
5,f,right ,q1nc1
6,g,and then across about two and go back up in ,q1nc1
7,f,do i go past the picket fence ,q1nc1
8,g,no ,q1nc1
9,g,right okay ,q1nc1
10,g,we're going ,q1nc1
11,g,see the old mill can you find the old mill on your map ,q1nc1
12,f,the mill wheel ,q1nc1
13,g,it's an old mill ,q1nc1
14,f,i don't have an old mill it says mill wheel must be the same thing ,q1nc1
15,g,okay right ,q1nc1
16,f,so ,q1nc1
17,f,i go down from the caravan park bef-- turn right before the picket fence ,q1nc1
18,g,you go to the old mill ,q1nc1
19,g,there's no picket fence here eh ,q1nc1
20,f,you don't have a picket f-- ,q1nc1
21,f,i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan park ,q1nc1
22,f,so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have it ,q1nc1
23,g,well ,q1nc1
24,g,no ,q1nc1
25,g,i go down and then i turn right n-- no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old ,q1nc1
26,g,have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park ,q1nc1
27,f,yeah ,q1nc1
28,f,it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on mine ,q1nc1
29,g,mm ,q1nc1
30,g,and ha-- have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the ca-- you've not to pass that fence ,q1nc1
31,f,well ,q1nc1
32,f,if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more or less hit the picket fence ,q1nc1
33,g,so then ,q1nc1
34,g,right i see ,q1nc1
35,g,so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fence ,q1nc1
36,g,if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first ,q1nc1
37,f,where's your ,q1nc1
38,f,actually go to it ,q1nc1
39,f,well ,q1nc1
40,g,mmhmm ,q1nc1
41,f,i you know i wouldn't have to really go down i could just i could just go you know down and to the right rather than go down and then turn right sort of thing ,q1nc1
42,g,hmm ,q1nc1
43,g,but is the idea is the idea so that you don't go there to the picket fence if i'm going to the old mill first ,q1nc1
44,f,wh-- where wh-- ,q1nc1
45,f,well ,q1nc1
46,f,i you i don't suppose you you you can go outside the picket fence ,q1nc1
47,f,eh i i could i could go down about you know two and a half inches and then go right and that would take me underneath my mill wheel right you know beneath it so that not not beneath it n-- on the map beneath it on the map ,q1nc1
48,g,right okay ,q1nc1
49,g,mmhmm ,q1nc1
50,f,you know ,q1nc1
51,f,so i can go down and then to the right and and you know another couple of inches and that's me below the mill wheel ,q1nc1
52,g,the old mill ,q1nc1
53,f,is that okay ,q1nc1
54,g,right ,q1nc1
55,g,can you can you s-- s-- can you s-- well can you see the abandoned cottage ,q1nc1
56,f,yeah ,q1nc1
57,f,that's in the middle of my map right in the middle of the page ,q1nc1
58,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
59,g,so if mm ,q1nc1
60,g,so if you go to the old mill and then y-- ,q1nc1
61,f,i'd if i need to go beneath the old mill right ,q1nc1
62,f,okay ,q1nc1
63,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
64,f,further along to the right and then up about six or seven inches 'til you get to the abandoned cottage so i d-- i do that do i ,q1nc1
65,g,mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm ,q1nc1
66,g,so you're going to your right old now going out to your right and then eh straight up to the round the abandoned cottage right ,q1nc1
67,f,okay so i right well ,q1nc1
68,f,i've not drawn anything yet ,q1nc1
69,f,i'll go down from the caravan park right ,q1nc1
70,g,mmhmm ,q1nc1
71,f,and then right ,q1nc1
72,g,is the point so that you it's not so that you d-- you avoid that that fence or have you got to go by that fence ,q1nc1

246,g,right okay ,q1nc1
247,g,may-- aye maybe that's what it is then ,q1nc1
248,g,oh right ,q1nc1
249,g,see where the see where your caravan park is then ,q1nc1
250,f,yeah ,q1nc1
251,f,i've got nothing above it i've nothing above the caravan park 'til the the west lake ,q1nc1
252,g,have you got something below it ,q1nc1
253,g,have you got a ca-- have you got a fence below it ,q1nc1
254,f,yeah ,q1nc1
255,f,the picket fence ,q1nc1
256,g,well ,q1nc1
257,g,did you go round it ,q1nc1
258,f,no ,q1nc1
259,f,i went over the mill the the picket fence er hasn't come into it right yet really ,q1nc1
260,g,di-- ,q1nc1
261,g,well ,q1nc1
262,g,see the caravan park ,q1nc1
263,g,i-- is there is there a picket fence underneath it ,q1nc1
264,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
265,g,well ,q1nc1
266,g,could you make a line go round it and then c-- ,q1nc1
267,g,is it bet-- is it like down and then the old mill's above from it ,q1nc1
268,f,yeah ,q1nc1
269,f,the the old mill's like northeast of it ,q1nc1
270,g,so can you not go round the picket fence and round the old mill do you not have to go round the picket fence no ,q1nc1
271,f,i don't think so ,q1nc1
272,f,that that's what we did first of all th-- the the the first line ,q1nc1
273,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
274,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
275,f,when i was asking you whether i could you know i had to eh stop before i got to the picket fence or not so but ,q1nc1
276,g,well ,q1nc1
277,g,do you not have to go round it ,q1nc1
278,f,why it's just a fence ,q1nc1
279,g,it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely ,q1nc1
280,f,you think so ,q1nc1
281,f,maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fence ,q1nc1
282,g,well ,q1nc1
283,g,maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know ,q1nc1
284,f,i've got one d-- i've got one i don't know realise why it's there ,q1nc1
285,g,right right you went by the abandoned cottage right ,q1nc1
286,f,i'm above the chimney just now ,q1nc1
287,g,right you're above the chimney ,q1nc1
288,g,and if you start going dow-- in an angle about forty-five degrees down ,q1nc1
289,f,mm mmhmm ,q1nc1
290,g,to the to where the bottom of the abandoned cottage ,q1nc1
291,g,right ,q1nc1
292,f,right okay ,q1nc1
293,g,'til oh right so ,q1nc1
294,g,you said you where are you now ,q1nc1
295,f,the bottom of the abandoned cottage ,q1nc1
296,g,right uh-huh ,q1nc1
297,g,but wh-- is there anything on your map beside that then on your left-hand side ,q1nc1
298,f,no i've got noth-- no i've got nothing between the caravan park and the west lake on the left-hand side ,q1nc1
299,g,well ,q1nc1
300,g,can you make sort of like right if you make a sort of ,q1nc1
301,g,if you make a sort of like a a forty-five degree angle right for about a couple of inches or something and then you start making a circle you know what if you know what i mean if you've got does a sort of angle then sort of curve round ,q1nc1
302,g,have you got a west lake ,q1nc1
303,f,yeah ,q1nc1
304,f,it's at the top left ,q1nc1
305,g,well can you can you make a sort of curve then if after your angle sort of like towards the west lake ,q1nc1
306,f,a curve ,q1nc1
307,f,whe-- where's your fenced meadow on the left-hand side ,q1nc1
308,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
309,g,sort of like you've gone ,q1nc1
310,g,mm ,q1nc1
311,f,where's your fenced meadow on the left-hand side ,q1nc1
312,g,it's about halfway up the page that's wh-- uh-huh it's just about about halfway up the page ,q1nc1
313,f,so would you know head sort of for the west lake now avoiding you know ,q1nc1
314,g,so if you s-- imagine a fenced meadow in the middle of the page ,q1nc1
315,g,and you sort of make a circle round up towards the west lake you go up to the west lake and then ,q1nc1
316,f,yeah ,q1nc1
317,f,along the left-hand side of the page ,q1nc1
318,g,mmhmm ,q1nc1
319,f,right ,q1nc1
320,f,right up to the top ,q1nc1
321,g,no ,q1nc1
322,g,you go ri-- you make a a ci-- you make a line up go up ,q1nc1
323,g,right ,q1nc1
324,f,right okay ,q1nc1
325,g,to the ti-- 'til you reach the west lake ,q1nc1
326,g,see the curve in the at the bottom of the west lake ,q1nc1
327,f,right yeah ,q1nc1
328,g,that sort of can you see a round curve ,q1nc1
329,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
330,g,go to the the eh furthest point of that like in your left-hand side right about the bottom of that curve ,q1nc1
331,f,yeah okay ,q1nc1
332,g,and start curving round it ,q1nc1
333,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
334,g,ti-- if you if you s-- ,q1nc1
335,g,can you see a trig point ,q1nc1
336,f,no ,q1nc1
337,g,no ,q1nc1
338,g,ehm ,q1nc1
339,g,right have you got the eh the west lake ,q1nc1
340,g,so make a curve round the bottom of that curve right so just follow that curve ,q1nc1
341,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
342,g,around west lake up to the just up to the point you know ,q1nc1
343,g,can you see on the west lake where it goes sort of straight ,q1nc1
344,f,yeah ,q1nc1
345,f,on the left-hand side ,q1nc1
346,g,no oh ,q1nc1
347,g,right ,q1nc1
348,f,where's your trig point ,q1nc1
349,f,do you cross the lake or do you go round it ,q1nc1
350,g,just just just go round ,q1nc1
351,g,right ,q1nc1
352,g,until about ,q1nc1
353,g,trying to think wh-- ,q1nc1
354,g,see right can you not ,q1nc1
355,g,see if there's a circle at the bottom know how you've just gone round it ,q1nc1
356,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
357,g,and you keep going up 'til about it's a kind of sh-- there's kind of angle ,q1nc1
358,g,oh this is really hard ,q1nc1
359,g,see where the farmed land is at the top ,q1nc1
360,f,yeah ,q1nc1
361,f,but that's at the at the right-hand side of my west lake ,q1nc1
362,g,uh-huh it's at the right-hand side ,q1nc1
363,f,yeah but i'm at the bottom left-hand side of the lake at the moment ,q1nc1
364,g,right well ,q1nc1
365,g,so are you at the bottom left-hand ,q1nc1
366,g,right ,q1nc1
367,f,i've just curved round the bottom ,q1nc1
368,g,and and you can cu-- you curve round the bottom and keep going up that curve just curve round that ,q1nc1
369,f,right ,q1nc1
370,f,so right round the top of the page ,q1nc1
371,g,no ,q1nc1
372,f,that's a-- no ,q1nc1
373,f,i'd have to otherwise i'd be in the lake ,q1nc1
374,g,se-- can you see a monument ,q1nc1
375,f,the monument's on the right-hand side ,q1nc1
376,g,yeah ,q1nc1
377,f,not all that far from the abandoned cottage in fact ,q1nc1
378,g,uh-huh that's what i mean ,q1nc1
379,g,and is the nuclear test site above it ,q1nc1
380,f,no ,q1nc1
381,f,i don't have a nuclear test site ,q1nc1
382,f,i've got a golf course ,q1nc1
383,f,have you got a golf course ,q1nc1
384,g,no ,q1nc1
385,f,no ,q1nc1
386,g,right ,q1nc1
387,g,have you got ,q1nc1
388,f,the golf course is just beneath the east lake about an inch or so down ,q1nc1
389,g,is it ,q1nc1
390,f,yeah ,q1nc1
391,g,up from its furthest point ,q1nc1
392,f,no ,q1nc1
393,f,from eh okay it's about two inches down from where it says east lake in the lake ,q1nc1
394,g,right ,q1nc1
395,f,there's a golf course it's not that big ,q1nc1
396,g,so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i think ,q1nc1
397,f,well ,q1nc1
398,f,let's get round the lake first the west lake ,q1nc1
399,f,so ,q1nc1
400,g,right ,q1nc1
401,f,i mean then then that's how i i'd need to go right round the top ,q1nc1
402,g,i take it they're the same shape on the maps then ,q1nc1
403,f,they must be ,q1nc1
404,g,right ,q1nc1
405,f,towards the top of the page unless i cross unless i cross the lake i'd need to go right round it ,q1nc1
406,g,right ,q1nc1
407,g,west lake isn't exac-- ,q1nc1
408,g,you don't want to cross the lake ,q1nc1
409,f,but how am i going to get to the farmland or any-- or anything else ,q1nc1
410,g,you don't want to go to the farmed land ,q1nc1
411,g,i just asked if i had if you had farmed land ,q1nc1
412,f,so i've to double back on myself ,q1nc1
413,g,no ,q1nc1
414,f,so what do where ,q1nc1
415,f,right ,q1nc1
416,f,i'm at the bottom of west lake ,q1nc1
417,f,right ,q1nc1
418,f,the left-hand side ,q1nc1
419,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
420,f,where do i go now ,q1nc1
421,g,right ,q1nc1
422,g,you you you curve round ,q1nc1
423,g,right ,q1nc1
424,g,see west lake you can see the curves can't you round west lake ,q1nc1
425,f,along the left-hand side ,q1nc1
426,g,on the left-hand side right ,q1nc1
427,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
428,g,right ,q1nc1
429,g,you've just come up from the abandoned cottage right ,q1nc1
430,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
431,g,and you've gone straight up ,q1nc1
432,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
433,g,to the bottom of west lake ,q1nc1
434,g,see directly underneath it where it says west lake ,q1nc1
435,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
436,f,oh ,q1nc1
437,f,i didn't actually i didn't actually go there ,q1nc1
438,g,"see the see see whe-- west lake see where the ""e"" is ",q1nc1
439,f,yeah ,q1nc1
440,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
441,g,directly under that you can then you see a curve going round to your right it's like a sort of bottom of a circle or something it's quite it's quite rounded ,q1nc1
442,f,yeah i know the i know the bit y-- ,q1nc1
443,f,the bottom right-hand side this is you're talking about ,q1nc1
444,g,mmhmm ,q1nc1
445,f,"you you talking about the ""e"" in lake ",q1nc1
446,g,mmhmm ,q1nc1
447,f,right ,q1nc1
448,g,oh god i forgot about that ,q1nc1
449,g,right ,q1nc1
450,g,you go down and just start ,q1nc1
451,g,right ,q1nc1
452,g,"see where the ""e"" in lake is right and ",q1nc1
453,g,go down to the bottom of that start tracing around that then towards your right ,q1nc1
454,f,we're going right now ,q1nc1
455,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
456,g,oh sorry have you been going right up the other side ,q1nc1
457,f,i thought we were ,q1nc1
458,f,i thought you were going left ,q1nc1
459,g,no ,q1nc1
460,g,we're going right ,q1nc1
461,f,so we're going from the abandoned cottage to below where it says lake ,q1nc1
462,g,right ,q1nc1
463,g,you've got you right you went to the abandoned cottage and you did a sort of circle ,q1nc1
464,f,right i've done that now ,q1nc1
465,f,and i and then i trace it back round ,q1nc1
466,f,right okay i'm doing that now ,q1nc1
467,g,uh-huh you are ,q1nc1
468,g,and you're going round ,q1nc1
469,f,around the bottom right-hand corner okay ,q1nc1
470,g,yeah ,q1nc1
471,g,round the curve and then up ,q1nc1
472,f,right ,q1nc1
473,g,round that curve and then up ,q1nc1
474,g,and you don't have a trig point ,q1nc1
475,f,no ,q1nc1
476,f,i've got all these lines on my on my map now ,q1nc1
477,g,see ehm where you've curved up from west lake do you know where i'm talking about see how there's a kind of sharp turn to the left ,q1nc1
478,f,that don't apply ,q1nc1
479,f,yeah ,q1nc1
480,g,in west lake ,q1nc1
481,f,at the top of the lake ,q1nc1
482,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
483,f,yeah ,q1nc1
484,g,and then you go down there's a kind of a bit you go straight down and then you go back up again ,q1nc1
485,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
486,g,if you can follow this ,q1nc1
487,g,right so you've went round the corner right ,q1nc1
488,g,start again ,q1nc1
489,f,the bottom right okay ,q1nc1
490,g,and see wh-- how i just said how it goes straight up and it goes down and it goes up ,q1nc1
491,f,yeah ,q1nc1
492,g,see that bit that goes up ,q1nc1
493,f,yeah ,q1nc1
494,g,the first time ,q1nc1
495,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
496,g,sort of sharp bit ,q1nc1
497,f,yeah ,q1nc1
498,g,right ,q1nc1
499,g,stop following the curve at the bottom of that ,q1nc1
500,f,right okay ,q1nc1
501,g,okay ,q1nc1
502,g,and see when you get to that ,q1nc1
503,g,do an angle follow that ,q1nc1
504,g,see that sort of straight angle ,q1nc1
505,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
506,g,do a straight line going to your towards your your right down to the left-hand side you're going down ,q1nc1
507,f,down to the right to my left-hand side ,q1nc1
508,g,right okay ,q1nc1
509,g,if d-- if you think of a compass so if it would be your ehm eh southwest ,q1nc1
510,f,but i'd be in the lake then ,q1nc1
511,g,no ,q1nc1
512,g,you wouldn't be in the lake you shouldn't ,q1nc1
513,f,i stop drawing the curve right ,q1nc1
514,g,mmhmm ,q1nc1
515,g,you haven't gone right round the lake have you ,q1nc1
516,f,no ,q1nc1
517,f,"i i started from the ""e"" in the lake ",q1nc1
518,f,right ,q1nc1
519,f,and eh traced it round the right-hand side and and up the side of west lake ,q1nc1
520,f,okay ,q1nc1
521,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
522,f,and i've stopped where the first eh the first bit rises ,q1nc1
523,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
524,f,at quite a sharp angle i've stopped at th-- at the r-- the right-hand side of that ,q1nc1
525,g,the bottom of that ,q1nc1
526,f,yeah ,q1nc1
527,g,well ,q1nc1
528,g,then you're going t-- ,q1nc1
529,f,how can i go southwest i uh i'd surely be in the lake ,q1nc1
530,g,oh east sorry ,q1nc1
531,f,southeast right okay ,q1nc1
532,g,sorry right uh-huh right ,q1nc1
533,g,god it's my directions ,q1nc1
534,g,you go east southeast down ,q1nc1
535,f,where to ,q1nc1
536,g,straight ,q1nc1
537,g,have you do you should have a monument ,q1nc1
538,f,where's the nuclear test site ,q1nc1
539,f,yeah ,q1nc1
540,g,right great ,q1nc1
541,g,right ,q1nc1
542,g,go down there straight and go right and ,q1nc1
543,g,do you see where the monument is ,q1nc1
544,g,do a straight line to the monument ,q1nc1
545,f,straight to the monument ,q1nc1
546,f,right okay ,q1nc1
547,g,to the bottom of the monument and curve round the monument just now ,q1nc1
548,f,and go up again ,q1nc1
549,g,and then you're starting to go up uh-huh go up a bit ,q1nc1
550,f,right ,q1nc1
551,f,where's the nuclear test site ,q1nc1
552,g,eh it's just it's almost straight up from the monument a few in-- a few inches ,q1nc1
553,f,so it's be-- next to the golf course then ,q1nc1
554,g,i don't know where your golf course is ,q1nc1
555,g,it's just it's about an inch under the east lake at the bottom of east lake ,q1nc1
556,f,yeah ,q1nc1
557,f,the golf course is is fairly near there ,q1nc1
558,f,so right i ,q1nc1
559,f,i'm going down ,q1nc1
560,f,okay ,q1nc1
561,g,so you've got the monument ,q1nc1
562,f,yeah i'm going ,q1nc1
563,g,just go st-- down straight line down underneath the monument ,q1nc1
564,f,right and ,q1nc1
565,g,and then up t-- curve up ,q1nc1
566,f,come back up again ,q1nc1
567,f,mmhmm ,q1nc1
568,g,eh go left for a couple of for about an inch or something ,q1nc1
569,g,okay ,q1nc1
570,f,how far do i go up here ,q1nc1
571,g,eh oh about an inch up from the monu-- just just curve sort of curve round a circle sort of ,q1nc1
572,f,so i i g-- i i go left beneath the nuclear test site ,q1nc1
573,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
574,g,you want to stay on the left-hand side uh-huh ,q1nc1
575,f,sorry ,q1nc1
576,g,you want to stay on the left-hand side ,q1nc1
577,g,right ,q1nc1
578,g,you go round the monument ,q1nc1
579,f,right ,q1nc1
580,f,and go left ,q1nc1
581,g,and s-- go left ,q1nc1
582,f,i've i've gone an inch or so up from the monument ,q1nc1
583,g,go left ,q1nc1
584,f,right ,q1nc1
585,g,and then go straight up towards the east lake ,q1nc1
586,f,so i go left along the left-hand side of the golf course ,q1nc1
587,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
588,f,what bit of east lake do i go up to ,q1nc1
589,g,just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curve ,q1nc1
590,f,i can imagine ,q1nc1
591,f,see where the see where the ,q1nc1
592,g,nuclear test site is ,q1nc1
593,f,the the left-hand side of the east lake at the bottom right ,q1nc1
594,f,if you draw a straight line down there that's the edge of the golf course so i can't go any i can't you know ,q1nc1
595,g,to the left-hand side of east lake like the very far end of east lake ,q1nc1
596,f,i can't ,q1nc1
597,f,yeah ,q1nc1
598,f,at the bottom ,q1nc1
599,f,i can't go any further left sorry further right than that because i've been i c-- i'd need to go through the golf course so i've actually you know that's where i am now more or less been-- beneath that point because that's the like the ,q1nc1
600,g,but that's where you're meant to end up underneath east lake ,q1nc1
601,f,at at the left-hand side ,q1nc1
602,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
603,f,at the bottom ,q1nc1
604,g,uh-huh ,q1nc1
605,f,so i just go from there now ,q1nc1
606,g,no ,q1nc1
607,g,that's the finish ,q1nc1
608,f,yeah i ,q1nc1
609,g,do you know where the farmed land is ,q1nc1
610,f,yeah the farmed land's between east and west lake ,q1nc1
611,g,yeah ,q1nc1
612,g,you go well your finish point's just beside east lake ,q1nc1
613,f,mmhmm right okay ,q1nc1
614,g,so if you went have you went round curved round the monument ,q1nc1
615,f,yeah yeah i've done that ,q1nc1
616,f,i i'm at the finish now ,q1nc1
617,g,are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've we-- you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake t-- ,q1nc1
618,f,i've not done that yet ,q1nc1
619,g,see where east lake is ,q1nc1
620,f,you didn't say that ,q1nc1

126,f,stretches ,q7ec6
127,f,yeah ,q7ec6
128,f,ju-- aba-- it's about an inch below the footbridge to about an inch fae the edge of the page fae the bottom of the page then about an inch in and it's about an inch and a half across ,q7ec6
129,g,an inch in from where ,q7ec6
130,f,an inch in from the left-hand side of the page ,q7ec6
131,g,and what do you mean an inch and a half across ,q7ec6
132,f,well that's how wide it is the banana tree ,q7ec6

442,g,go up follow the side of the mountain up to that point still staying about half a centimetre away to a centimetre ,q7ec6
443,f,right ,q7ec6
444,g,and then have you got anything above that point above white mountain ,q7ec6
445,f,i've got lemon grove that's about two inches above it ,q7ec6

452,g,right ,q7ec6
453,g,now ,q7ec6
454,g,go straight up just now until you're about on go due north until you're on a level with about the a third of the way up the pyramid ,q7ec6
455,g,you see the black marks up the side of the pyramid ,q7ec6
456,f,uh-huh the second one ,q7ec6
457,g,until you're level with the second one ,q7ec6
458,f,so i'm going to go by the west side of the lemon grove ,q7ec6
459,g,uh-huh ,q7ec6
460,g,and now would that take you above the lemon grove ,q7ec6
461,f,yeah ,q7ec6
462,g,now go straight across until you're about an inch from the second black mark of the pyramid ,q7ec6
463,f,black mark ,q7ec6
464,f,got you ,q7ec6
465,g,now ,q7ec6
466,g,from there go to a point a centimetre above the peak of the pyramid ,q7ec6
467,f,got you ,q7ec6
468,g,right ,q7ec6
469,g,and then draw a straight line down the other side ,q7ec6
470,g,um you see the the bottom right-h-- right-hand corner of the pyramid ,q7ec6
471,f,yeah the far away one the one that's ,q7ec6
472,g,the one that would be at the front of the pyramid ,q7ec6
473,f,yeah ,q7ec6
474,g,right the face not the one that would be at the back not the extreme right-hand point ,q7ec6
475,f,right ,q7ec6
476,f,mmhmm ,q7ec6
477,g,about an inch out from there put a dot and join those two points and the ,q7ec6

482,f,mm ,q7ec6
483,g,now ,q7ec6
484,g,"from there draw a slightly sloping curve again to below the ""d"" of pyramid ",q7ec6
485,g,right just slope it round the natural way it would go ,q7ec6
486,f,mmhmm ,q7ec6
487,g,right ,q7ec6
488,g,curve it round ,q7ec6

21,f,right ,q8nc1
22,f,i haven't got a tribal settlement ,q8nc1
23,g,aha ,q8nc1
24,f,right ,q8nc1
25,f,so i just i go sh-- sh-- straight down ,q8nc1
26,g,so i 'pose you just ,q8nc1
27,g,you go sort of off the top of the volcano sort of thing ,q8nc1
28,g,above the volcano and then down past it on the left ,q8nc1
29,f,right ,q8nc1
30,f,right ,q8nc1
31,g,and then sort of down along the page straight along the bottom of the page ,q8nc1
32,f,straight along about the same level as the volcano ,q8nc1
33,g,a bit below it a bit below it ,q8nc1
34,g,and then there's a there's a on mine there's a tribal settlement ,q8nc1
35,g,right ,q8nc1
36,f,right i haven't got one of them ,q8nc1

48,f,i've got a ,q8nc1
49,f,right ,q8nc1
50,g,okay ,q8nc1
51,g,once you get to the other side of the rope bridge you go down about an inch and then you go straight along again towards the right and up ,q8nc1
52,f,wait a minute down about an inch ,q8nc1
53,g,okay ,q8nc1
54,f,right ,q8nc1

60,f,right ,q8nc1
61,g,anyway you go down about an inch and along ,q8nc1
62,f,mmhmm to the right right ,q8nc1

88,f,mmhmm ,q8nc1
89,f,uh-huh ,q8nc1

85,g,you want to be ,q6nc6
86,f,i've also got a manned fort ,q6nc6
87,g,right well ,q6nc6
88,g,you want to go straight down i don't know miss your manned fort and s-- the level you want to get to in this sort of curve is it should be directly ,q6nc6
89,f,am i going in a curve ,q6nc6
90,g,a slight curve basically s-- basically straight down and then curve slightly so you're eh right underneath the white water and just slightly above the level of the stone slabs it should be in the sort of shape of an eye ,q6nc6
91,g,you know the sideways shape of an eye you get at school ,q6nc6
92,g,that sort of idea of a curve ,q6nc6

10,f,uh-huh ,q4nc6
11,g,see how there's about a centimetre ,q4nc6
12,f,yeah ,q4nc6

14,f,right ,q4nc6
15,f,just missing the camera shop ,q4nc6
16,g,just missing the camera shop yeah ,q4nc6

22,g,see between the start and the allotments ,q4nc6
23,f,uh-huh ,q4nc6
24,g,do the same distance again between that in fact a wee bit more i'd say about twelve thirteen centimetres down to the bottom ,q4nc6
25,f,down ,q4nc6
26,g,right ,q4nc6
27,f,right okay ,q4nc6
28,g,so you should be about a centimetre away from the left-hand side of the page and about two s-- two or three centimetres above the bottom ,q4nc6
29,f,the bottom of the page ,q4nc6
30,g,right ,q4nc6
31,f,oh wait a minute wh-- fr-- how many centimetres from the w-- ,q4nc6

56,g,because what you're doing is you're going up the side of the allotments ,q4nc6
57,f,right okay i'm just ,q4nc6
58,g,"so you're doing you're continuing that ""u"" shape from where you were at the start you're sort of going back up heading north towards the side of the allotments ",q4nc6
59,g,right ,q4nc6
60,f,right ,q4nc6
61,g,see the wee black house at the left-hand side of the allotments ,q4nc6

75,g,right this is where it gets difficult ,q4nc6
76,g,eh ,q4nc6
77,f,right ,q4nc6
78,g,'cause you're aiming into the middle of nowhere there's about ,q4nc6
79,g,i've got a yacht club right ,q4nc6
80,g,at the bottom right-hand side ,q4nc6
81,f,ehm ,q4nc6
82,f,uh-huh right ,q4nc6
83,g,right ,q4nc6
84,g,see if you forget about the line for a minute if you pick a point about sssh ,q4nc6

86,f,uh-huh ,q4nc6
87,g,the bottom edge of it the corner ,q4nc6
88,f,right ,q4nc6
89,g,if you aim above that for about six centimetres right ,q4nc6
90,f,right ,q4nc6
91,g,a point up there ,q4nc6
92,f,uh-huh ,q4nc6
93,g,if you can draw a diagonal line from the wee black house in the allotments up to the top up to the where that point is about six centimetres ,q4nc6

48,g,uh-huh ,q8nc5
49,g,uh-huh ,q8nc5

59,g,you can go about a centimetre above the rav-- the ravine ,q8nc5
60,g,okay ,q8nc5
61,g,and then ,q8nc5
62,f,still to the left of it ,q8nc5
63,g,uh-huh uh-huh ,q8nc5

69,g,bef-- so don't go as far as the pine grove ,q8nc5
70,f,mmhmm ,q8nc5
71,g,right ,q8nc5
72,g,so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up ,q8nc5
73,f,right ,q8nc5
74,g,but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet ,q8nc5
75,f,okay ,q8nc5
76,g,so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove ,q8nc5
77,g,you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove ,q8nc5
78,g,i'm not making this very easy am i right ,q8nc5
79,f,okay ,q8nc5
80,f,mmhmm ,q8nc5
81,g,see what i mean ,q8nc5
82,f,uh-huh ,q8nc5
83,g,so you go down until you're a-- ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove ,q8nc5
84,f,bottom left-hand corner ,q8nc5
85,g,mmhmm ,q8nc5
86,f,but not ehm touching it or ,q8nc5
87,g,no not touching ,q8nc5

98,f,uh-huh ,q8nc5
99,g,okay well ,q8nc5
100,g,i haven't got that ,q8nc5
101,g,but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right ,q8nc5
102,f,mmhmm ,q8nc5
103,g,okay ,q8nc5
104,g,moving down all the time ,q8nc5

110,g,right ,q8nc5
111,g,what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve r-- to the right again acro-- along the top of this concealed hideout ,q8nc5
112,f,but i d-- i don't go along the bottom of the pine grove ,q8nc5
113,g,no ,q8nc5
114,f,so it's not much of a curve ,q8nc5
115,g,no ,q8nc5
116,f,right eh ,q8nc5
117,f,and i end up to the left of the concealed hideout ,q8nc5
118,g,no ,q8nc5
119,g,you're going you're going to go to the right of the concealed hideout you're going to go along the top to the right ,q8nc5

121,f,right ,q8nc5
122,g,mmhmm ,q8nc5
123,f,okay ,q8nc5

65,f,right ,q7ec2
66,g,well that'll be about a centimetre below the beech trees ,q7ec2
67,f,mmhmm ,q7ec2
68,f,"so finish up next to the ""s"" of seven ",q7ec2
69,g,basically yes ,q7ec2
70,f,okay ,q7ec2
71,g,"right on my drawing i've got a chapel that's about an inch long on the on the map it starts directly below the ""s"" and eh ",q7ec2
72,g,"we've got to go round this in sort of a circular direction you're going to be moving east and then back and finishing about under the second beech tree the right-hand beech tree so you want to what you want to do is you're going down about two inches again but you've got a eh a net move east of about an inch so from the ""s"" you've got about two inches down and one inch two inches south and about one inch east and you want to come round eh about about one inch one inch east and one inch south and do a curve ",q7ec2
73,f,curve that one ,q7ec2
74,g,right curve it ,q7ec2
75,g,and then you want to go in a southwest of there like direction until you meet the eh the what i ini-- what i init-- ini-- i initially said ,q7ec2
76,g,okay ,q7ec2
77,g,this is complicated ,q7ec2
78,f,how about ,q7ec2
79,g,but what your point your initial point mark a point two inches south one inch east of the where you stopped the last time ,q7ec2
80,f,uh-huh ,q7ec2
81,g,okay have you done that yes ,q7ec2
82,f,yes ,q7ec2
83,g,eh to get the curve i would go one inch down from where your your point is just now and ,q7ec2
84,f,one inch south ,q7ec2
85,g,one inch south ,q7ec2
86,g,and one inch east and now you want to do a curve from your initial point to that point then down to the two inch ,q7ec2
87,f,then then straight down to the two inch mark ,q7ec2
88,g,no ,q7ec2
89,g,it's southwest er about five ten degrees off south to the southwest to finish under the beech tree the the right-hand beech tree ,q7ec2
90,f,going southwest ,q7ec2
91,g,going southwest ,q7ec2
92,f,to finish under the second beech tree i would have to go southeast if i only moved over one inch to the east in the first movement because you said two inches ,q7ec2
93,g,t-- ,q7ec2
94,g,well make it one and a half inch sorry one and a half inch east ,q7ec2
95,f,what's one and a half ,q7ec2
96,g,you what you want to do is you want to clear the eh first movement round the chapel will have to clear the beech trees and then come down again to under the first ts on the right-hand beech tree ,q7ec2
97,f,right ,q7ec2
98,f,i'll try and describe it to you what i think ,q7ec2
99,f,"i've come down from to the ""s"" i'm at the ""s"" just now ",q7ec2
100,g,right ,q7ec2
101,f,of seven i'll continue down but curving round to my right ,q7ec2
102,g,yeah ,q7ec2
103,f,okay until i've done a quarter curve a quarter of a circle ,q7ec2
104,g,that's right yeah ,q7ec2

397,f,right ,q4nc4
398,g,okay ,q4nc4
399,f,right okay ,q4nc4
400,g,and then i would say you're about three cen-- four centimetres ,q4nc4
401,g,you're following the edge of the east lake right up for about a centimetre beyond the left-hand edge of it ,q4nc4
402,g,see where it gets pointy ,q4nc4
403,f,so i'm going up i'm going up the l-- so i'm going over to the left here ,q4nc4

408,g,right ,q4nc4
409,f,okay ,q4nc4
410,g,and that's the finish that's it about a centimetre beyond the edge of that ,q4nc4

0,g,right ,q4ec8
1,g,ehm the diamond mine the d-- the diamond mine is like just eh to the the the right of you there ,q4ec8
2,f,right i've got the diamond mine ,q4ec8
3,f,i've got the start and the diamond mine ,q4ec8
4,g,right ,q4ec8
5,g,"now just go down beside the left-hand side of the diamond mine and eh just to below the words the first ""d"" there ",q4ec8
6,f,right ,q4ec8
7,g,"then draw a line ehm a kind of go from there eh to just below the ""s"" of springboks ",q4ec8
8,f,don't have springboks ,q4ec8
9,g,you don't have spri-- that's right ,q4ec8
10,g,ehm okay right ,q4ec8
11,g,"in that case just draw a horizontal line to just below the eh to the the left of the ""h"" of highest viewpoint ",q4ec8
12,f,horizontal ,q4ec8
13,g,yes horizontal right ,q4ec8
14,f,hold on right ,q4ec8
15,g,now we're going to go round eh highest viewpoint ,q4ec8
16,g,okay ,q4ec8
17,g,so eh ,q4ec8
18,f,a curve or ,q4ec8
19,g,"it well we can do it in a well just go eh vertically up to the ""h"" ",q4ec8
20,f,right ,q4ec8
21,g,then make a curve round to the eh like a semicircle ,q4ec8
22,g,right ,q4ec8
23,f,okay ,q4ec8
24,g,eh is there anything below there ,q4ec8
25,f,there's the overgrown gully ,q4ec8
26,g,right ,q4ec8
27,g,and eh what about safari truck ,q4ec8
28,f,yes i've got that ,q4ec8
29,g,now where's the overgrown gully ,q4ec8
30,f,it's between highest viewpoint and the safari truck ,q4ec8
31,g,eh what the midway between them ,q4ec8
32,f,yes ,q4ec8
33,g,and eh to the left or right of highest viewpoint ,q4ec8
34,f,it's beneath it ,q4ec8
35,f,it's to the right-hand side ,q4ec8
36,g,it's directly beneath it ,q4ec8
37,g,to the right-hand side of safari truck ,q4ec8
38,f,slightly to the right-hand side ,q4ec8
39,g,right of this one right okay ,q4ec8
40,f,right to the middle of highest viewpoint anyway ,q4ec8
41,g,okay right ,q4ec8
42,g,so go on the outsides eh towards the paper edge ehm down to safari truck in a a slight curve ,q4ec8
43,f,right ,q4ec8
44,g,and then eh draw a diagonal line ehm from there across the top of safari truck down to field station ,q4ec8
45,f,that's on my map it's slightly above field station slightly above safari truck ,q4ec8
46,g,what is above that f-- ,q4ec8
47,f,above that's field station's on a level slightly above safari truck ,q4ec8
48,g,right ,q4ec8
49,g,well mine's eh on the same level ,q4ec8
50,g,ehm it what what is there anything else that's in eh that's causing it to be up like that ,q4ec8
51,f,well there's a banana tree direc-- directly below diamond mine ,q4ec8
52,g,right ,q4ec8
53,f,it's slightly below safari truck slightly below the level of safari truck ,q4ec8
54,g,right okay ,q4ec8
55,g,well eh wh-- you're just next to the eh that what was the object you've just drawn past ,q4ec8
56,f,i've just drawn past the overgrown gully ,q4ec8
57,f,i'm now at the top right-hand corner of safari truck ,q4ec8
58,g,right ,q4ec8
59,g,ehm well draw eh a kind of diagonal line and then turn it ,q4ec8
60,f,up or down ,q4ec8
61,g,eh from right to left eh downwards ,q4ec8
62,g,eh underneath field station ,q4ec8
63,f,right that's way over the la-- the far left-hand side of the page on my map ,q4ec8
64,g,where is field station ,q4ec8
65,f,field station's way over the far left ,q4ec8
66,g,it's the far l-- uh ,q4ec8
67,g,well there's two field stations on my map ,q4ec8
68,f,there's not one on mine ,q4ec8
69,g,right ,q4ec8
70,g,so you've only got one there ,q4ec8
71,f,yes ,q4ec8
72,g,and none there in the centre right ,q4ec8
73,g,ehm in that case you want to draw the diagonal line and then ,q4ec8
74,g,where is banana tree ,q4ec8
75,f,banana tree is directly below diamond mine and it's slightly above the centre of the page ,q4ec8
76,g,right ,q4ec8
77,g,so eh well draw this d-- diagonal line down and then change it to a curve at the top level of banana tree and curve it round banana tree ehm with the apex of the curve pointing to the top right-hand corner sorry left-hand corner ,q4ec8
78,f,right what was that again sorry ,q4ec8
79,g,right ,q4ec8
80,f,this pen's running out i think ,q4ec8
81,g,if you hold it eh vertically it'll come down ,q4ec8
82,f,it's gone ,q4ec8
83,f,ah right ,q4ec8
84,g,is it okay now ,q4ec8
85,f,yes ,q4ec8
86,g,right ehm right i'll just do the the bit at the safari truck right ,q4ec8
87,g,draw a diagonal line from where you were ,q4ec8
88,g,right ,q4ec8
89,f,right ,q4ec8
90,g,eh to the same just below the s-- the level of s-- the word safari truck and ab-- abou-- between banana tree and safari truck ,q4ec8
91,f,okay ,q4ec8
92,f,okay ,q4ec8
93,g,which is slightly above eh banana tree ,q4ec8
94,f,right ,q4ec8
95,g,right ,q4ec8
96,g,then draw a curve over banana tree ehm and curving round on it ,q4ec8
97,f,down the left-hand side ,q4ec8
98,g,right ,q4ec8
99,g,and ehm now do you have gold mine between eh banana tree and rock fall at the bottom there ,q4ec8
100,f,no ,q4ec8
101,g,right ,q4ec8
102,g,in that case eh well gold mine on my map is halfway between rock fall and banana tree ,q4ec8
103,f,okay ,q4ec8
104,f,directly below ,q4ec8
105,g,okay ,q4ec8
106,g,it's directly below banana tree and directly above rock fall a-- ,q4ec8
107,f,right ,q4ec8
108,g,and it's eh in the at the mid point of the two of that line ,q4ec8
109,f,okay ,q4ec8
110,g,right ,q4ec8
111,g,so ehm i want you to come down to two thirds of the way between eh rock fall and banana tree have ,q4ec8
112,f,is that two thirds beneath banana tree or two thirds up ,q4ec8
113,g,two t-- eh that's two third beneath banana tree ,q4ec8
114,f,right ,q4ec8
115,g,right ehm now there i want you to draw ehm a horizontal line to the left sorry to the right sorry eh to the right just eh so that you're on the other side of banana tree if you understand ,q4ec8
116,f,right ,q4ec8
117,g,then the rope bridge can you see that on your map ,q4ec8
118,f,yes ,q4ec8
119,f,that's slightly above it's between where i am and banana tree roughly about halfway between ,q4ec8
120,g,between where you are and where ,q4ec8
121,f,banana tree ,q4ec8
122,g,right well ,q4ec8
123,f,it's on a line roughly between that it's over to the right-hand side of the page ,q4ec8
124,g,right ,q4ec8
125,g,ehm are crocodiles the other side of the thing ,q4ec8
126,f,yes ,q4ec8
127,g,yeah ,q4ec8
128,g,ehm and eh the crocodile's to the right of the rope bridge ,q4ec8
129,f,yes ,q4ec8
130,g,right ,q4ec8
131,f,to the right and below ,q4ec8
132,g,right and below right ,q4ec8
133,g,ehm what i want you to do is ,q4ec8
134,g,is there anything between the go-- eh between the where you are now and the rope bridge ,q4ec8
135,f,no ,q4ec8
136,g,right ,q4ec8
137,g,i want you to draw a line up to the rope bridge ,q4ec8
138,f,straight line ,q4ec8

144,g,i want you to eh draw round the crocodile eh on the outside of the page down to giraffes ,q4ec8
145,f,right ,q4ec8
146,g,right i want you to go underneath the giraffes ,q4ec8
147,g,and there's any other obstacles there ,q4ec8
148,f,there's a disused warehouse at the bottom roughly about two a third of the way in from the right ,q4ec8
149,g,right ,q4ec8
150,g,right ,q4ec8
151,g,is it eh bel-- is it above great lake and below g-- giraffes ,q4ec8
152,f,no ,q4ec8
153,f,it's to the right of great lake on a level with it ,q4ec8
154,g,right ,q4ec8
155,g,well in that case i want you to ehm eh curve slightly up to eh just go underneath the giraffes and eh to on a level with the the word giraffes and stop there ,q4ec8
156,f,right ,q4ec8
157,g,right now i want you to eh go round the warehouse eh and under the great lake ,q4ec8
158,g,by round i mean over like over the eh the warehouse ,q4ec8
159,f,okay ,q4ec8
160,f,right ,q4ec8
161,g,right and then under the great lake ,q4ec8
162,g,is there any other obstacles there ,q4ec8
163,f,no ,q4ec8
164,g,and then come up between eh ,q4ec8
165,g,now it's the great lake and eh rock fall halfway between them but over to the left-hand side of the page is the finish point ,q4ec8
166,f,okay ,q4ec8
167,g,right ,q4ec8
0,g,starting at the beginning head due south ,q3ec1
1,g,you'll see a diamond mine on your map ,q3ec1
2,f,mmhmm ,q3ec1
3,g,avoid the diamond mine ,q3ec1
4,f,due south ,q3ec1
5,g,going due south followed by east ,q3ec1
6,f,to the left of the diamond mine ,q3ec1
7,f,to the west ,q3ec1
8,g,east the right ,q3ec1
9,f,so you want me to go east then south ,q3ec1
10,g,no ,q3ec1
11,g,south then east ,q3ec1
12,g,we may have a different map ,q3ec1
13,f,uh-huh right ,q3ec1
14,g,can you head due south ,q3ec1
15,f,sorry ,q3ec1
16,g,can you head due south ,q3ec1
17,f,i can head due south ,q3ec1
18,f,am i meant i'm meant to draw this on aren't i right ,q3ec1
19,g,and can you then head to the right past the diamond mine ,q3ec1
20,f,yes ,q3ec1
21,g,go for it ,q3ec1
22,f,how far ,q3ec1
23,g,you'll see a graveyard ,q3ec1
24,g,do you see a graveyard on your map to the right of the diamond mine ,q3ec1
25,f,no ,q3ec1
26,g,right ,q3ec1
27,g,they've obviously not marked the graveyard ,q3ec1
28,f,how far to the right of diamond mine is it ,q3ec1
29,g,the graveyard is almost halfway in between ,q3ec1
30,g,do you have carved stones ,q3ec1
31,f,i have carved stones at the top followed by a ravine followed by an indian country ,q3ec1
32,g,right ,q3ec1
33,g,in between the diamond mine and the carved stones is the graveyard that's where it should be ,q3ec1
34,f,right ,q3ec1
35,g,so what you need to do is continue past the diamond mine then past where you think the graveyard is ,q3ec1
36,f,and then stop ,q3ec1
37,f,past where it is ,q3ec1
38,g,yeah ,q3ec1
39,g,go rou-- same under under the graveyard south of the graveyard ,q3ec1
40,f,is the graveyard due east of the diamond mine ,q3ec1
41,g,the graveyard's ,q3ec1
42,g,correct ,q3ec1
43,f,so i really shouldn't hit it then if i'm south of the diamond mine ,q3ec1
44,g,correct ,q3ec1
45,f,right okay ,q3ec1
46,g,s-- you then come no-- up north just to the left to the west of the carved stones ,q3ec1
47,f,okay ,q3ec1
48,g,so if you're almost on top of carved stones then you'll totally miss the graveyard ,q3ec1
49,f,okay ,q3ec1
50,f,right so i am now just directly north of the carved stones and slightly north of the start ,q3ec1
51,g,that's correct ,q3ec1
52,g,so you move east around carved stones ,q3ec1
53,f,the carved stones ,q3ec1
54,g,and then do you have gallows on your map ,q3ec1
55,f,yes ,q3ec1
56,f,but they're absolutely miles away ,q3ec1
57,g,that's correct that's correct ,q3ec1
58,g,all you need to do is go due south from the carved stones as far as you can see the gallows the same level as the gallows ,q3ec1
59,f,past ,q3ec1
60,f,right ,q3ec1
61,g,you should be on top of the indian country correct ,q3ec1
62,f,um and just south of the ravine ,q3ec1
63,g,that's right ,q3ec1
64,g,do you have a great rock ,q3ec1
65,f,i have a great rock ,q3ec1
66,g,it's to the west of indian country ,q3ec1
67,f,no ,q3ec1
68,f,it's very very southwest of indian country ,q3ec1
69,g,right ,q3ec1
70,g,that's a different great rock ,q3ec1
71,g,okay what you have to do is ,q3ec1
72,g,now that you're paral-- parallel with the gallows right ,q3ec1
73,f,mmhmm ,q3ec1
74,g,you're on a level with the gallows ,q3ec1
75,f,i'm on a level ,q3ec1
76,g,head southwest that's to the left and down past indian country ,q3ec1
77,f,move west followed by south down to ,q3ec1
78,g,no ,q3ec1
79,g,s-- straight southwest ,q3ec1
80,f,okay ,q3ec1
81,g,not too far ,q3ec1
82,f,right ,q3ec1
83,f,i'm just below indian country ,q3ec1
84,g,do you see the gold mine ,q3ec1
85,g,do you see the gold mine ,q3ec1
86,f,which is due we-- due west ,q3ec1
87,g,uh-huh ,q3ec1
88,f,yeah ,q3ec1
89,g,i want you to go ,q3ec1
90,g,west making sure that you remain above the gold mine ,q3ec1
91,g,understand ,q3ec1
92,g,so you go due west above the gold mine ,q3ec1
93,f,okay ,q3ec1
94,g,but n-- not too far north 'cause otherwise you'll hit the rock so i want you to head just above the gold mine ,q3ec1
95,f,right ,q3ec1
96,g,are you above the gold mine now ,q3ec1
97,f,i'm ,q3ec1
98,g,just to the west of it ,q3ec1
99,f,just i'm just to the east of it ,q3ec1
100,f,do you want me to go f-- slightly further ,q3ec1
101,g,yeah ,q3ec1
102,g,i want you to go just past it ,q3ec1
103,f,right ,q3ec1
104,g,so you're basically in the gap between the gallows and the gold mine ,q3ec1
105,f,and the gold mine right ,q3ec1
106,g,and i want you to go due sou-- ,q3ec1
107,g,do you have a trout farm ,q3ec1
108,f,yes ,q3ec1
109,f,but ,q3ec1
110,g,right ,q3ec1
111,f,it's ,q3ec1
112,f,that is coming due south followed by due east just above the totem pole just above the totem pole if you had the totem pole ,q3ec1
113,g,that's correct i think ,q3ec1
114,g,want you to head due south as far south as the trout farm just below the trout farm ,q3ec1
115,f,just above the trout farm ,q3ec1
116,g,b-- just below the trout farm ,q3ec1
117,f,right ,q3ec1
118,f,i'm i think i'm just below the trout farm ,q3ec1
119,g,and head east ,q3ec1
120,f,east ,q3ec1
121,f,and land just below the trout farm ,q3ec1
122,g,ah do you have any other obstacles ,q3ec1
123,f,none ,q3ec1
124,g,in the way ,q3ec1
125,g,well head due east just below the trout farm trying to avoid any obstacles on your way ,q3ec1
126,f,okay ,q3ec1
127,f,i'm just below it directly below it i'm not east or west of it ,q3ec1
128,g,right ,q3ec1
129,g,now i've got a cavalry stockade on this map ,q3ec1
130,f,a cavalry a cattle stockade ,q3ec1
131,g,no ,q3ec1
132,g,cavalry it's a fort thing ,q3ec1
133,f,right ,q3ec1
134,g,so we need to avoid that ,q3ec1
135,f,well we don't ,q3ec1
136,g,which means ,q3ec1
137,f,is it directly south ,q3ec1
138,g,it's almost south of the sou-- the trout farm it's south and slightly to the east ,q3ec1
139,f,mmhmm ,q3ec1
140,g,so i want you to go right past the trout farm almost to the edge of the map to make sure we miss it ,q3ec1
141,f,okay ,q3ec1
142,g,so you're past your totem pole there as well you're ,q3ec1
143,f,my totem pole is directly below my gold mine ,q3ec1
144,g,that's all right ,q3ec1
145,g,right ,q3ec1
146,g,i want you to go due south now ,q3ec1
147,f,how far ,q3ec1
148,g,ehm do you have a cattle stockade ,q3ec1
149,f,i do ,q3ec1
150,f,just above it ,q3ec1
151,g,right ,q3ec1
152,g,just below it you want to go round the bottom of it ,q3ec1
153,f,do you want me to go to the bottom of the page ,q3ec1
154,g,uh-huh that's correct ,q3ec1
155,f,right ,q3ec1
156,g,i want you to go west below the stockade ,q3ec1
157,f,and below the parched river bed which i don't know if you have ,q3ec1
158,g,although oh i don't have a river bed so ,q3ec1
159,f,do you have a bandit t-- ,q3ec1
160,g,is your river bed ,q3ec1
161,g,whereabouts is level becau-- ,q3ec1
162,f,do you have a bandit territory ,q3ec1
163,g,uh-huh ,q3ec1
164,f,directly bas-- directly we-- west of your cattle stockade ,q3ec1
165,g,correct ,q3ec1
166,f,that's in the middle of the two ,q3ec1
167,g,right ,q3ec1
168,g,my map deviates here so i presume that's why you must have an obstacle ,q3ec1
169,g,"so what i want you to do is go west as far left as the sta-- s-- just the edge of the ""c"" of the s-- cattle stockade ",q3ec1
170,f,m-- ,q3ec1
171,f,mmhmm ,q3ec1
172,g,then do you have to go up to avoid the ,q3ec1
173,f,well if there's a very very thin line i ca-- i can go up though yes ,q3ec1
174,g,because that's how this map indicates ,q3ec1
175,g,so i want you to go up not straight up ehm northwest ,q3ec1
176,f,i can go north then west ,q3ec1
177,g,up up in a curve ,q3ec1
178,g,i want you to go northwest in a one-er ,q3ec1
179,f,right will i go in a one-er ,q3ec1
180,g,uh-huh ,q3ec1
181,g,it's a curve curve shape ,q3ec1
182,f,right you want me to curve ,q3ec1
183,f,where t-- where am i curving to ,q3ec1
184,g,curving up to the northwest followed by down to the southwest ,q3ec1
185,f,so you ,q3ec1
186,g,s-- so i want you to go basically curve up and then down ,q3ec1
187,f,you want me to go you want to curve up to about the level of the great rock i don't know if you have that ,q3ec1
188,g,no ,q3ec1
189,g,not as far as that ,q3ec1
190,f,see m-- ,q3ec1
191,g,only a small curve ,q3ec1
192,f,oh okay ,q3ec1
193,g,to about the m-- the middle of the fencing of the sto-- the cattle stockade ,q3ec1
194,f,north east ,q3ec1
195,g,northwest to the left of the page ,q3ec1
196,f,okay ,q3ec1
197,f,and then curve back down to the bottom of the page ,q3ec1
198,g,uh-huh that's correct ,q3ec1
199,g,'cause presumably we must be avoiding the river is that correct ,q3ec1
200,f,yeah ,q3ec1
201,g,and then we go due west along the bottom under the bandit territory ,q3ec1
202,f,okay ,q3ec1
203,g,and then curve round and up to the finish ,q3ec1
204,g,do you have finish on your map ,q3ec1
205,f,i don't have a finish ,q3ec1
206,f,above my bandit territory about an inch i have a great rock followed by two inches then a totem pole ,q3ec1
207,g,right ,q3ec1
208,g,keep going past the bandit terri-- territory ,q3ec1
209,f,due north ,q3ec1
210,g,are due west of the bandit territory yet ,q3ec1
211,f,i am now west of bandit territory ,q3ec1
212,g,right ,q3ec1
213,g,continue until you're about an inch two inches away from the edge of the page ,q3ec1
214,f,right ,q3ec1
215,g,and curve up to it the point just above the s-- cactus of the bandit terri-- territory ,q3ec1
216,g,understand ,q3ec1
217,f,just dire-- ,q3ec1
218,g,so on the level ,q3ec1
219,f,just basically right above it but not touching it ,q3ec1
220,g,no ,q3ec1
221,g,the level of it but about an inch two inches in from the page ,q3ec1
222,f,alright ,q3ec1
223,g,understand what i mean ,q3ec1
224,f,right so basically just due north to the level of the ,q3ec1
225,g,correct ,q3ec1
226,f,right ,q3ec1
227,g,"and that's your ""x"" that's your finish ",q3ec1
228,f,is it ,q3ec1
0,g,okay phil ,q2nc2
1,f,right ,q2nc2
2,g,on my map i have a telephone kiosk in the bottom left-hand corner ,q2nc2
3,f,uh-huh ,q2nc2
4,g,okay the route starts above it ,q2nc2
5,f,mmhmm ,q2nc2
6,g,directly above it about on my map about half an inch from the top of the telephone kiosk ,q2nc2
7,f,yeah got you ,q2nc2
8,g,okay ,q2nc2
9,g,it's a dotted line that moves around to the left of the k-- telephone kiosk down ,q2nc2
10,f,mmhmm ,q2nc2
11,g,passing around the left-hand side of the stone circle ,q2nc2
12,f,stone circle ,q2nc2
13,g,yeah ,q2nc2
14,f,how don't think i've got that on my map i have a telephone kiosk and a the nearest thing is a broken gate to the bottom right-hand ,q2nc2
15,g,yeah ,q2nc2
16,g,well under on on my map directly under the telephone kiosk ,q2nc2
17,f,mmhmm ,q2nc2
18,g,at the right on the bottom left-hand corner of the page i have a stone circle ,q2nc2
19,f,yeah ,q2nc2
20,f,right ,q2nc2
21,g,so if you could take your route straight down 'til about an inch above the bottom of the page ,q2nc2
22,f,uh-huh ,q2nc2
23,g,okay ,q2nc2
24,f,right ,q2nc2
25,g,then go straight straight on ,q2nc2
26,f,to the r-- ,q2nc2
27,g,horizontally about and for about another inch ,q2nc2
28,f,to the right ,q2nc2
29,g,yeah to the right ,q2nc2
30,f,right ,q2nc2
31,g,okay ,q2nc2
32,f,okay ,q2nc2
33,g,now if you move straight up you're going to be on the left-hand side of that farmer's gate ,q2nc2
34,f,right ,q2nc2
35,g,that correct ,q2nc2
36,f,yeah ,q2nc2
37,g,okay ,q2nc2
38,g,if you move straight up until you're at the top left-hand corner of the broken gate ,q2nc2
39,f,mmhmm ,q2nc2
40,f,right ,q2nc2
41,g,okay ,q2nc2
42,g,now we're going to move do you have a meadow in the bottom right-hand corner ,q2nc2
43,f,meadow yeah uh-huh ,q2nc2
44,g,okay ,q2nc2

46,g,do you have little seagulls drawn on it ,q2nc2
47,f,no not at all ,q2nc2
48,g,little birds ,q2nc2

56,f,right ,q2nc2
57,g,so if you take the middle bird ,q2nc2
58,f,uh-huh ,q2nc2
59,g,and you move up the page until you're probably about to a point that's about half an inch horizontally higher than the point you're at at the farmer's gate ,q2nc2
60,f,right ,q2nc2
61,g,okay ,q2nc2
62,f,mmhmm ,q2nc2
63,g,now if you take your route from where you are now to that point ,q2nc2
64,f,right ,q2nc2
65,g,diagonally upwards ,q2nc2
66,f,right ,q2nc2
67,g,okay we're going to move up from there to the ruined monastery ,q2nc2
68,f,right ,q2nc2
69,g,and your route's ,q2nc2
70,f,h-- have you got overnight accommodation on yours ,q2nc2
71,g,no i don't ,q2nc2
72,f,well i've got overnight accommodation in a diagonal line between the ruined monastery and the point i'm at just now ,q2nc2
73,g,in a diagonal line ,q2nc2
74,f,yeah ,q2nc2
75,f,it's about if upwards was north it would be northwest of where i am just now ,q2nc2
76,g,yeah oh that sounds that sounds like the same route that i have here ,q2nc2
77,g,does that take you up to the top right-hand corner say of the the ruined monastery you know just off the ruined monastery ,q2nc2
78,f,erm well ,q2nc2
79,g,by that pa-- ,q2nc2
80,f,if i was goi-- to go up in a straight line just now i'd end up slightly to the right of the ruined monastery ,q2nc2
81,g,okay ,q2nc2
82,g,well it's slightly diagonally northwest as you said ,q2nc2
83,f,yeah well that's through the overnight accommodation then ,q2nc2
84,g,well that's that'd be good ,q2nc2
85,f,i don't suppose that's an obstacle really ,q2nc2
86,g,no ,q2nc2
87,g,that'd be quite good actually ,q2nc2
88,f,right go straight through it then ,q2nc2
89,g,yeah ,q2nc2
90,g,we're going right up there and around the top of the ruined monastery curving round the top ,q2nc2
91,f,curving round the top the right-hand side or the left-hand side ,q2nc2
92,g,oh we're coming up you're coming up on the right-hand side ,q2nc2
93,f,mmhmm ,q2nc2

123,g,past the bottom of the ruined monastery ,q2nc2
124,f,right ,q2nc2
125,g,okay now you're going to curve it back ,q2nc2
126,g,do you have a stile ,q2nc2

128,f,eh yeah uh-huh ,q2nc2
129,g,yeah ,q2nc2

131,g,well if you can curve it round until a point that's directly below the left-hand corner of the stile ,q2nc2
132,f,mmhmm ,q2nc2
133,g,and then move straight upwards towards the left-hand side skim round the left-hand side of the stile ,q2nc2
134,f,am i doing an arc eh that's curving up and over to the left ,q2nc2
135,g,yeah ,q2nc2
136,g,you've just done one that's curved down ,q2nc2
137,f,uh-huh ,q2nc2

48,g,what you'd best to do is go along past the bottom go along okay sorry go along to your right and veer slightly upwards as you reach the creek ,q1ec5
49,f,mmhmm ,q1ec5
50,g,and then go over and round the creek to your right ,q1ec5
51,g,and then ehm ,q1ec5
52,g,do you have an apache camp ,q1ec5
53,f,uh-huh ,q1ec5
54,g,right ,q1ec5
55,g,see when you're over the top of the fast or your creek or the river that i've got here when you're over the top of that and in line vertically in line with the apache camp ,q1ec5
56,f,mmhmm ,q1ec5
57,f,mmhmm ,q1ec5
58,g,go south until just above the apache camp ,q1ec5
59,f,okay ,q1ec5
60,g,right ,q1ec5
61,g,when you reach the apache camp ,q1ec5
62,g,ehm do you have a walled city ,q1ec5
63,f,right away on the far left ,q1ec5
64,g,right ,q1ec5
65,g,well you're going to go from above the apache camp to the walled city but you've got to avoid a carved wooden pole ,q1ec5
66,g,which in my map is slightly above the level of the apache camp ,q1ec5
67,f,no this is vertically in line with the walled city below it ,q1ec5
68,g,right ,q1ec5
69,f,okay so ,q1ec5
70,g,right i've got one of them as well ,q1ec5
71,f,right ,q1ec5
72,g,so ,q1ec5
73,g,but there's another one a carved wooden pole here which is halfway between the walled city and the apache camp ,q1ec5
74,g,okay ,q1ec5
75,f,mmhmm ,q1ec5
76,g,but slightly above the level of the apache camp ,q1ec5
77,f,so ,q1ec5
78,f,i'd be better to go underneath it ,q1ec5
79,g,okay ,q1ec5
80,g,uh-huh ,q1ec5
81,f,right ,q1ec5
82,g,so you've got so you're going from above the apache camp underneath the carved wooden pole and over the top of the walled city ,q1ec5
83,g,and then when you reach the far si-- yo-- your left-hand side of the walled city travel southwards until you come to the level of some flat rocks ,q1ec5
84,f,uh-huh ,q1ec5
85,g,and go bel-- ,q1ec5
86,g,do you have a stone creek ,q1ec5
87,f,uh-huh ,q1ec5
88,g,right so ,q1ec5
89,g,what i want you to do is go between the flat rocks and the stone creek ,q1ec5
90,g,but do you have anything between the walled city and the carved wooden pole ,q1ec5
91,f,ghost town ,q1ec5
92,g,a ghost town ,q1ec5
93,g,so you're going to ,q1ec5
94,g,that's not on my map ,q1ec5
95,g,you've got to avoid that i think ,q1ec5
96,f,okay ,q1ec5
97,g,so go south down past the walled city underneath your ghost town and then slightly up sort of northeast direction between the flat rocks and the stone creek ,q1ec5
98,f,between ,q1ec5
99,f,well ,q1ec5
100,f,it'd be better if i s-- s-- between the walled city and the ghost town no to go underneath it above it ,q1ec5
101,f,or have you got something else there ,q1ec5
102,g,i've not got anything betw-- between the carved wooden pole and the walled city ,q1ec5
103,g,"but the map shows a curve a ""c""-shaped curve ",q1ec5
104,f,right ,q1ec5
105,f,score that out ,q1ec5
106,g,right ,q1ec5
107,f,right ,q1ec5
108,g,and sort of and then slightly up underneath the flat rocks and above the stone creek ,q1ec5
109,f,right ,q1ec5
110,g,okay ,q1ec5
111,g,then ,q1ec5
112,g,go slightly to your right beyond the flat rocks until you are above the level of the buffalo ,q1ec5
113,f,so i i'll be avoiding the saloon bar ,q1ec5
114,g,i don't have a saloon bar here ,q1ec5
115,f,i've got here ,q1ec5
116,g,right ,q1ec5
117,g,okay so avoid the saloon bar ,q1ec5
118,f,right ,q1ec5
119,g,and ehm then right then ehm ,q1ec5
120,g,just straight down to the right of the buffalo ,q1ec5
121,f,to the right ,q1ec5
122,g,y-- ,q1ec5
123,g,so that so that you're on you're on the right of the buffalo ,q1ec5
124,f,right ,q1ec5
125,g,okay ,q1ec5
126,g,and go underneath the buffalo ,q1ec5
127,g,now ,q1ec5
128,g,do you have a cattle ranch ,q1ec5
129,f,no ,q1ec5
130,g,ehm do you have a fort ,q1ec5
131,f,mmhmm ,q1ec5
132,g,so you're going to go from the buffalo to the fort but you've got to avoid the cattle ranch on the way and you'll have to go up and over the top of the cattle ranch ,q1ec5
133,f,right ,q1ec5
134,g,which on my map is halfway between the buffalo and the fort ,q1ec5
135,g,okay ,q1ec5
136,f,right ,q1ec5
137,f,that on the the level between the fort mm ,q1ec5
138,g,ehm ,q1ec5
139,g,it's almost on level with the fort but it's slightly higher than the fort ,q1ec5
140,f,so ,q1ec5
141,g,so you need to be go up on a sort of hill ,q1ec5
142,f,mmhmm ,q1ec5
143,g,over the cattle ranch ,q1ec5
144,g,underneath buffalo or over the cattle ranch ,q1ec5
145,f,right ,q1ec5
146,g,then underneath the fort ,q1ec5
147,f,under the fort ,q1ec5
148,g,underneath the fort uh-huh ,q1ec5
149,g,and come out at the left-hand side of the fort and finishing ehm not beside but on the same level as the the carved wooden pole the base of the carved woode-- wooden pole ,q1ec5
150,f,right ,q1ec5
151,g,okay that's you finished ,q1ec5
152,f,okay ,q1ec5
0,g,right neil erm at the bottom ,q2nc3
1,g,right-hand corner of your map do you have a missionary camp ,q2nc3
2,f,yeah ,q2nc3
3,g,"about half an inch above it we've got an ""x"" marking start ",q2nc3
4,g,have you got that ,q2nc3
5,f,yes ,q2nc3
6,f,yes ,q2nc3
7,g,right ,q2nc3
8,g,erm now i want you to take a route about one inch directly west ,q2nc3
9,g,if the top of the page is north and the left-hand side of the page is west ,q2nc3
10,g,i want you to go about one inch west ,q2nc3
11,f,okay ,q2nc3
12,g,now eh ,q2nc3
13,g,we're heading about two inches southwest ,q2nc3
14,g,eh which should leave you t-- at the bottom left-hand corner of the missionary camp about an inch diagonally away from it ,q2nc3
15,f,right ,q2nc3
16,f,got you ,q2nc3
17,g,and then ab-- about an inch from the bottom of the page as well ,q2nc3
18,f,sure okay ,q2nc3
19,g,now on your map on the left-hand bottom corner do you have a bunch of rather nasty looking gorillas ,q2nc3
20,f,no i don't ,q2nc3
21,g,well i do and i think it's something we might want to avoid ,q2nc3
22,f,right ,q2nc3
23,g,right so erm ,q2nc3
24,g,my route tells me to go on a slightly dipping downwards line west but don't draw it yet 'til i give you the exact instructions ,q2nc3
25,f,okay ,q2nc3
26,g,this line is dipping slightly down and to the left keeping about well you'd be better to go to within about half an inch of the bottom of the page so at the bottom left-hand corner you should be about an inch from both the left-hand side and the bottom of the page a-- a half an inch from the a-- ,q2nc3
27,g,sorry i'll start that again ,q2nc3
28,g,should be an inch from the left-hand side of the page and half an inch from the bottom side of the page at the bottom left-hand corner ,q2nc3
29,g,okay ,q2nc3
30,f,is this avoiding the banana tree ,q2nc3
31,g,avoiding no ,q2nc3
32,g,avoiding gorillas ,q2nc3
33,g,have you got banana tree ,q2nc3
34,f,i've got a banana tree ,q2nc3
35,f,but it's probably in much the same place ,q2nc3
36,g,yeah ,q2nc3
37,f,right ,q2nc3
38,f,i'll just go to where you say it avoids the banana tree anyway ,q2nc3
39,g,right okay ,q2nc3
40,g,so you're heading s-- s-- west but slightly southerly ,q2nc3
41,f,yeah ,q2nc3
42,g,right ,q2nc3
43,g,stop about an inch from the left-hand side of the page ,q2nc3
44,f,yeah ,q2nc3
45,g,should be at a point about half an inch off the bottom of the page now ,q2nc3
46,f,yeah ,q2nc3
47,g,right ,q2nc3
48,g,now i think we should eh read the banana tree as where the gorillas live so ,q2nc3
49,f,right ,q2nc3
50,g,erm avoiding the banana tree i suppose ,q2nc3
51,g,erm go about ,q2nc3
